INTRODUCTION
Photography is generally considered to have had its birth in 1839, when the Frenchman Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre first revealed his photographic process to the public.
The roots of photography, however, were developed much earlier.
The camera obscura, for example, had been known since ancient times.
Meaning literally “darkened room,” it was originally a room completely sealed from light except for a very small hole in one wall.
An image of the outside world - houses, trees, and even people - could be projected, upside down and reversed right-to-left, onto a wall or white screen placed opposite the opening.
Later the camera obscura was reduced in size until it became a small portable box.
It was equipped with a lens and a mirror at a 45-degree angle, which reflected the image upward and focused it on a viewing screen.
This was a great aid to artists in making sketches on location, but there was not yet a way to capture directly and permanently the camera obscura’s images.
Scientists had known for some time that certain silver compounds, then called silver salts and now named silver halides, would turn black when exposed to light.
In England, Thomas Wedgwood, son of the famous potter, experimented with one of these silver halides, silver nitrate, to produce silhouettes.
The pictures, however, were not permanent and turned black unless stored in the dark.
In the early 19th century Joseph-Nicéphore Niépce of France began to experiment with a then novel graphic arts printing method called lithography.
His work led him to further experiments using bitumen, a resinous substance, and oil of lavender.
Niépce developed a process whereby he could permanently capture the image of a camera obscura.
In 1827 he made the world’s first surviving photograph from the window of a country home in France.
It required an exposure, in bright sunlight, of eight hours.
<Caption> Daguerreotypists Albert Sands Southworth and Josiah Johnson Hawes of Boston took this profile portrait of Susan B. Anthony, c. 1850.
Meanwhile, Daguerre was experimenting with silver-iodide images.
Hearing of Niépce’s work, he contacted him, and in 1829 they became partners.
During the next few years Daguerre, with Niépce’s help, worked out the process that came to be known as daguerreotypy.
It was a complicated procedure that demanded considerable skill.
A silver-coated sheet of copper was sensitized by treatment with iodine vapor, forming a coating of light-sensitive silver iodide.
The daguerreotype plate was exposed in the camera and then developed in mercury fumes at temperatures of about 50° C (120° F).
The exposed areas absorbed mercury atoms and highlighted the image.
Finally, the image was fixed by washing it in hypo (sodium thiosulfate).
The daguerreotype’s silver image was capable of rendering exquisitely fine detail.
It was a single-image process, however - each exposure produced only one picture, incapable of reproduction.
Furthermore, the process required exposures of up to several minutes even in bright sunlight, thus constraining its subjects to absolute motionlessness.
In spite of this, the process immediately became popular, particularly for portraiture.
Daguerreotypy rapidly developed into a thriving business in England and the United States.
Superb portraits were made by such daguerreotypists as Albert Sands Southworth and Josiah Johnson Hawes in Boston.
The French excelled in landscapes and cityscapes.
In 1840 a much faster lens was designed by the Hungarian József Petzval and manufactured by Peter Voigtlander in Austria.
At about the same time a method was discovered that increased considerably the light sensitivity of the daguerreotype plate.
This method involved a second fuming with chlorine or bromine before exposure.
In England William Henry Fox Talbot had developed his own method of photography at about the same time that Daguerre was inventing the daguerreotype.
Talbot impregnated paper with silver nitrate or silver chloride.
When exposed in a camera, the sensitized paper turned black where light struck it, creating a negative image of the subject.
This was made permanent by fixing with hypo.
To achieve a positive image, a contact print could be made by placing the negative over a second piece of sensitized paper and exposing the combination to bright light.
Talbot’s “photogenic drawings,” as he called them, lacked the daguerreotype’s sharp detail and brilliance but offered the great advantage that from one negative a large number of positive prints could be made.
His process, known as the calotype, and later talbotype, process, was at first less popular than the daguerreotype.
Most later methods of photography, however, have evolved from Talbot’s work.
His was the first negative-positive process.
In 1851 F. Scott Archer of England made public his wet-collodion process, in which he used a glass plate coated with collodion as a base for light-sensitive silver halides.
His procedure, requiring seven steps, was only slightly less complicated than the daguerreotype process, but it was considerably less expensive.
It also produced a negative that was much sharper than that of the calotype method.
Soon the wet-collodion process had supplanted both the older techniques as the most widely used process of photography.
A major inconvenience of the wet-collodion method was the fact that the plate was light-sensitive only as long as it remained wet; after it dried it lost its sensitivity.
Thus plates had to be used almost immediately after preparation.
Since these plates could not be prepared and stockpiled in advance, a portable darkroom, in the form of a tent, wagon, or railway car, for instance, had to accompany the camera wherever it went.
Despite this drawback, intrepid photographers made photographs in remote locations and under the most dangerous conditions, creating images that are still considered masterpieces of the medium.
Roger Fenton of England became a pioneer in war photography with his camp scenes from the Crimean War.
Mathew Brady and his team of associates, including Alexander Gardner, Timothy O’Sullivan, and James Gibson, achieved a magnificent documentation of the American Civil War.
After the war, Gardner, O’Sullivan, and William Henry Jackson photographed the opening of the American West and provided a lasting record of its awesome scenery.
In the mid-1850s the tintype, an inexpensive imitation of the daguerreotype, was patented by the American Hamilton L. Smith.
It was, in fact, not made of tin, but of a very thin sheet of iron specially treated and coated with a light-sensitive emulsion.
The tintype became very popular for personal portraits.
Stereoscopic photography also became extremely popular during this period.
A special stereo camera with two lenses was used to take two simultaneous photographs of the subject from viewpoints separated by about the same distance as a pair of human eyes.
When the resulting pictures were viewed through a special viewing device, they merged to create a three-dimensional image.
Stereoscopic images of travel pictures, landscapes, important events, and comic pictorial short stories were sold by the millions.
In 1871 a new era in photography began when an amateur English photographer, R.L. Maddox, produced a successful dry plate that retained its light-sensitivity after drying.
Other inventors followed his lead, and soon fast, reliable dry plates, much more convenient to use than the earlier wet plates, became available at a reasonable cost.
The dry plate represented a turning point in photography.
With the availability of faster emulsions, photographers could make exposures on the order of a fraction of a second, and for the first time the camera was freed from a stand.
A new breed of smaller, more portable cameras proliferated, variously called hand cameras or detective cameras.
With fast-dry plates, and later with film, photography could be practiced by amateurs without the need for professional training or equipment.
As shutter speeds became fast enough to stop motion, a fascinating new world of vision unfolded.
Especially notable was the work of the Englishman Eadweard Muybridge, who pioneered work in the field of motion-picture projection.
He photographed sequences of human and animal motion that fascinated artists, anatomists, and the general public alike.
In the 1880s the American George Eastman put flexible roll film on the market, and in 1889 he introduced the first Kodak camera with the slogan, “You push the button and we do the rest.”
Thus was launched the era of mass-market photography.
Meanwhile, gifted photographers were exploring the new medium from a creative standpoint, attempting to discover its potential and limitations and define photography as an art form.
At first it was only natural that photographers should take their inspiration from painting.
Oscar G. Rejlander and Henry Peach Robinson, for example, working in England, used various darkroom techniques, tricks, and manipulations to produce staged photographs that frankly imitated the sentimental, moralistic paintings of the era.
The English amateur Julia Margaret Cameron did not take up photography until she was almost 50.
Nevertheless, she imposed her own personal style on the medium and produced a collection of extraordinary portraits that were soft focused but impassioned.
Another English amateur, Peter Henry Emerson, developed a strong pictorial style of his own and advanced detailed theories of photographic aesthetics that had a considerable influence on late 19th-century art photographers.
The American Alfred Stieglitz, a distinguished photographer in his own right, began to promote photography as a fine art in the pages of his illustrated quarterly Camera Work, in his Photo-Secession group, and later in his 291 gallery.
A new generation of photographers emerged who were determined to turn away from the pictorial style and its soft-focus, painterly effects to a more direct, unmanipulated, and sharply focused approach.
This new form was called “straight” photography, and its practitioners believed it most truly expressed photography’s unique vision.
One pioneer was Paul Strand, whose photographs reveal a deep awareness of what he called “the spirit of place.”
The movement’s most famous figures were Edward Weston and his younger associate Ansel Adams.
From the late 19th century on, many photographers began to use the medium to document social problems.
A Danish immigrant to the United States, Jacob A. Riis, became a crusader with a camera, revealing the plight of the urban poor.
To illuminate the interior of slum tenements he often used the recent German invention, flashpowder, a highly explosive mixture that ignited in a blaze of white light.
Later, another American, Lewis Hine, took up photography to draw the public’s attention to such social ills as the abuses of child labor.
During the Great Depression of the 1930s a large-scale program in documentary photography was established in the United States.
Organized by Roy Stryker, talented photographers such as Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, and Ben Shahn compiled an unsurpassed portrait of the nation.
Technical developments in photographic equipment continued.
Shortly before World War I, Oskar Barnack in Germany, working as a technician for the E. Leitz company, invented a miniature camera that used perforated strips of 35-mm film.
It was first introduced to the market in 1924 as the Leica.
Many dismissed it as a mere toy ill-equipped for serious work, but others were delighted by its compact size and ability to make up to 36 exposures in rapid succession.
Continual improvement over the years established the 35-mm camera, especially in its single-lens reflex form, as the dominant camera for both professionals and serious amateurs.
In 1930 the highly dangerous flashpowder was largely supplanted by flashbulbs.
At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, experiments with gas discharge flash tubes led to the development of the electronic flash, which could produce astonishing images made at exposures as brief as 110,000 second.
Although they originally required expensive and cumbersome equipment, electronic flash units became so miniaturized that they could be built into a pocket camera.
Color had been the dream of photographers since the medium of photography was invented.
The foundation for color photography had been established in 1859 by James Clerk Maxwell, a Scottish physicist who demonstrated that all colors could be reduced to combinations of three primary colors.
Many attempts were made to apply this principle to photography, but it was not until many decades later that inventors were successful.
In 1907 two Frenchmen, the brothers Auguste and Louis Lumière, placed on the market their autochrome glass plates.
These plates were coated with starch grains that were dyed red, green, and blue, over which was a second coating of panchromatic emulsion.
After 1930 the much sharper “integral tripack” color films were introduced, which used dyes rather than grains.
Kodachrome in particular became famed for its sharpness and rich colors.
These new films were positive transparency films, but soon color negative films were introduced.
Today color negative film constitutes the vast majority of film sold to amateur photographers who use non-digital color photography in the United States.
With the rapid rise in digital photography in the 2000s, color negative film sales dropped significantly and today the color negative film mostly is used for specialized niche markets.
Instant, or self-processing, photography was invented by the American Edwin H. Land.
He introduced the Polaroid Land camera in 1947, and a color version became available in 1963.
In art photography, a new class of photographers began to conduct experiments in cameraless abstractions, images produced directly on film without the use of a camera.
Principal among these photographers were the Hungarian-born László Moholy-Nagy, a teacher in the Bauhaus school in Germany, and the American Man Ray.
In the years before World War II the rise of picture magazines in Europe provided a showcase for such talented photographers as Martin Munkacsi, André Kertész, and Ilse Bing.
Other photographers - notably Raoul Hausmann, John Heartfield, and George Grosz - used their cameras to make outspoken political and social protests in the form of photomontages, or collages of powerful, often savage images.
Picture-oriented, mass-market magazines such as Life and Look flourished during the post–World War II decades, bringing the work of many outstanding photographers to the public.
Margaret Bourke-White, an innovative photojournalist during the war, and W. Eugene Smith became famous for their powerful picture essays.
Henri Cartier-Bresson exhibited unprecedented precision in his perception and capture of the significant moment, and Richard Avedon and Irving Penn explored new frontiers of fashion photography.
The advent of television caused a decline in such picture-oriented magazines, but photography as an art form continues to thrive.
Increasingly, cameras have become more automated and electronically controlled.
Virtually every step, from film loading to rewinding, became automatic.
In the mid-1990s the technology of photography was combined with computer technology to produce a consumer digital camera, with which it was possible to take a picture that could then be accessed and manipulated through a desktop computer.
Unlike film cameras, digital cameras do not use film.
An electronic sensor and a memory card are used to record the images.
Traditional viewfinders are still common, but most have an LCD screen by which a picture can be viewed immediately.
A semiconductor device measures light intensity and color that are transmitted through the camera’s lenses.
Light strikes the light receptors, or pixels on the semiconductor and an electric current is induced and converted to binary digits for storage within another digital medium such as a flash memory or some other removable storage device.
In addition to the camera itself, other components of the photographic process changed as well.
In the early 1990s a new type of film was introduced.
Known as a dry film because it did not require the usual chemical processing, it was coated with a selenium-based compound instead of the usual silver halide and was recyclable.
With the introduction of smartphones in the 21st century, the handheld devices became more computer-like and their megapixel (millions of pixels) digital cameras could take sharp images with high-quality resolutions.
In addition, everyone who owned a smartphone had access to a camera at any point in time.
In spite of the increasing sophistication of the equipment, however, the photographer’s eye continues to be all-important.
Photography remains a unique human act.

CHAPTER ONE
CAMERAS AND LENSES
When one speaks of the technology of photography one usually refers to the equipment, techniques, and processes that are used in the production of photographs.
The most widely employed photographic process used to be the black-and-white negative–positive system (see the figure below).
In the camera the lens projects an image of the scene being photographed onto a film coated with light-sensitive silver salts, such as silver bromide.
A shutter built into the lens admits light reflected from the scene for a given time to produce an invisible but developable image in the sensitized layer, thus exposing the film.
<Caption> This illustration shows the sequence of negative-positive process, from the photographing of the original scene to enlarged print.
During development (in a darkroom) the silver salt crystals that have been struck by the light are converted into metallic silver, forming a visible deposit or density.
The more light that reaches a given area of the film, the more silver salt is rendered developable and the denser the silver deposit that is formed there.
An image of various brightness levels thus yields a picture in which these brightnesses are tonally reversed - a negative.
Bright subject details record as dark or dense areas in the developed film; dark parts of the subject record as areas of low density; i.e., they have little silver.
After development the film is treated with a fixing bath that dissolves away all undeveloped silver salt and so prevents subsequent darkening of such unexposed areas.
Finally, a wash removes all soluble salts from the film emulsion, leaving a permanent negative silver image within the gelatin layer.
<Caption> Pictured in this photograph are a roll of black-and-white film, strips of coloured negative film, and coloured slides in and out of their cases.
A positive picture is obtained by repeating this process.
The usual procedure is enlargement: the negative is projected onto a sensitive paper carrying a silver halide emulsion similar to that used for the film.
Exposure by the enlarger light source again yields a latent image of the negative.
After a development and processing sequence the paper then bears a positive silver image.
In contact printing the negative film and the paper are placed face to face in intimate contact and exposed by diffused light shining through the negative.
The dense (black) portions of the negative image result in little exposure of the paper and, so, yield light image areas; thin portions of the negative let through more light and yield dark areas in the print, thus re-creating the light values of the original scene.
THE CAMERA AND LENSES
In its simplest form, the camera is a light-tight container carrying a lens, a shutter, a diaphragm, a device for holding (and changing) the film in the correct image plane, and a viewfinder to allow the camera to be aimed at the desired scene. (
Digital cameras, lenses, and techniques are discussed in Chapter 8.)
BASIC CAMERA FUNCTIONS
The lens projects an inverted image of the scene in front of the camera onto the film in the image plane.
The image is sharp only if the film is located at a specific distance behind the lens.
This distance depends on the focal length of the lens and the distance of the object in front of the lens.
To photograph near and far subjects, all but the simplest cameras have a focusing adjustment that alters the distance between the lens and the film plane to make objects at the selected distance produce a sharp image on the film.
In some cameras focusing adjustment is achieved by moving only the front element or internal elements of the lens, in effect modifying the focal length.
<Caption> An illustration depicts the cross section of a single-lens reflex (SLR) camera with a flip mirror.
The shutter consists of a set of metallic leaves mounted in or behind the lens or a system of blinds positioned in front of the film.
It can be made to open for a predetermined time to expose the film to the image formed by the lens.
The time of this exposure is one of the two factors controlling the amount of light reaching the film.
The other factor is the lens diaphragm, or aperture, an opening with an adjustable diameter.
The combination of the diaphragm opening and exposure time is the photographic exposure.
To obtain a film image that faithfully records all the tone gradation of the object, this exposure must be matched to the brightness (luminance) of the subject and to the sensitivity or speed of the film.
Light meters built into most modern cameras measure the subject luminance and set the shutter or the lens diaphragm to yield a correctly exposed image.
PRINCIPAL CAMERA TYPES
The simplest camera type, much used by casual amateurs, has most of the features listed in the previous section - lens, shutter, viewfinder, and film-holding system.
The light-tight container traditionally had a box shape.
Present-day equivalents are pocket cameras taking easy-load film cartridges or film disks.
Typically, a fixed shutter setting gives about 1/50-second exposure; the lens is permanently set to record sharply all objects more than about five feet (1.5 metres) from the camera.
Provision for a flash may be built in.
Though simple to handle, such cameras are in daylight restricted to pictures of stationary or slow-moving subjects.
THE 35-MM MINIATURE CAMERA
Perforated 35-millimetre (mm) film (originally standard motion-picture film) in cartridges holding 12 to 36 exposures with a nominal picture format of 24 × 36 mm is employed in miniature cameras.
Smaller image formats down to 18 × 24 mm (half frame) may be used.
The 35-mm camera has a lens with a range of apertures and a shutter with exposure times typically from one second to 1/1,000 second or shorter, and it can focus on subject distances from infinity down to five feet or less.
A winding lever or built-in motor advances the film from one frame to the next and at the same time tensions (cocks) the shutter for each exposure.
At the end of the film load the film is rewound into the cartridge for removal from the camera in daylight.
A 35-mm camera usually has a direct-vision viewfinder, often combined with a rangefinder or autofocus system for accurate distance settings.
Most current versions incorporate a light meter coupled with the exposure settings on the camera.
Advanced models may have interchangeable lenses and an extended accessory system.
Many 35-mm cameras are single-lens reflex types.
THE ULTRAMINIATURE OR SUBMINIATURE
This camera takes narrow roll film (16-mm or 9.5-mm) in special cartridges or film disks.
The picture size ranges from 8 × 10 mm to 13 × 17 mm.
These formats are used for making millions of snapshooting pocket-size cameras; special versions may be as small as a matchbox for unobtrusive use.
SHUTTER TYPES
One basic type of shutter that is found on many simple and compact 35-mm cameras is composed of overlapping leaves and is located between the front and rear elements of the lens.
The leaves open and close to admit light.
This is called a leaf or between-lens shutter.
A second type, found on 35-mm interchangeable-lens cameras, is the focal-plane shutter, located in the back of the camera just in front of the film.
With this type of shutter, two opaque blinds, or curtains, sweep in front of the film.
The curtains are adjusted to create slits of various widths.
Most cameras provide a method of adjusting shutter speed, either by mechanical or electronic means.
The shutter speeds may range from a full second to as little as 1/4,000 of a second.
A typical range of marked shutter speeds for an average 35-mm SLR camera might be as follows: 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/15, 1/30, 1/60, 1/125, 1/500, 1/1,000.
Note that each marked setting is approximately twice as fast as the preceding one and half as fast as the following one.
Many cameras also have either a T (for time) or B (for bulb or brief) setting, which allows the photographer to make longer exposures than those provided by the marked shutter-speed settings.
This feature is useful for taking photographs after dark and for creating special effects.
Many cameras are also equipped with a self-timer.
Photographers can place the camera on a tripod or other support, activate the self-timer, and be allowed several seconds to put themselves in the picture before the shutter is tripped.
These aperture and shutter-speed combinations allow the same amount of light to enter the camera but result in different images.
Smaller apertures extend the zone of sharp focus, and slow shutter speeds show blurred movement.
Shutter speed determines how effectively a moving object can be “stopped” - that is, how sharply it can be reproduced without blurring or streaking in the final image.
With a fast shutter speed, the shutter is opened only briefly and the moving object has little time to change its position before the exposure is completed.
With a slow shutter speed, on the other hand, the shutter remains open for a relatively long time.
Thus the faster the shutter speed, the sharper a moving object will appear on the final image, and the slower the shutter speed, the more blurred the object will appear.
This principle also holds true for camera motion.
The faster the shutter speed, the less noticeable any shaking of the camera will be in the final photograph.
This is particularly relevant when holding a camera while taking a picture with a telephoto lens.
The lens magnifies the effect of camera motion, so that if the camera is moved even slightly when the picture is taken, the final image will appear blurred.
To avoid this, many photographers select a shutter speed of no slower than 1/125 of a second for hand-held shooting, though some photographers are successful with a speed of 1/60 or even 1/30 of a second.
The camera shutter must stop the subject’s apparent speed or the speed at which its image moves across the film, regardless of the subject’s actual motion through space.
Factors such as distance, direction of motion, and focal length of the lens must all be taken into consideration.
Generally, the closer the moving subject is to the camera, the greater its apparent motion will be.
Thus, if they wish to get a sharp image, most photographers avoid extreme close-ups of moving subjects.
In action pictures, the focal length also plays a role in the final image.
A lens with a long focal length will magnify the image and its apparent motion.
Apparent motion is greatest when the subject is moving at right angles across the line of sight, and it is least when the subject is moving directly toward or away from the camera.
Much of the time photographers wish to stop all motion for a sharp, clear image.
Sometimes, however, they use slower shutter speeds to produce expressive blurs of motion.
THE VIEW, OR TECHNICAL, CAMERA
For studio and commercial photography the view, or technical, camera takes single exposures on sheet films (formerly plates) usually between 4 × 5 inches and 8 × 10 inches.
A front standard carries interchangeable lenses and shutters; a rear standard takes a ground-glass screen (for viewing and focusing) and sheet-film holders.
The standards move independently on a rail or set of rails and are connected by bellows.
Both standards can also be displaced laterally and vertically relative to each other’s centre and swung or tilted about horizontal and vertical axes.
These features provide versatility in image control (sharpness distribution, subject distance, and perspective), though not speed in use.
The view camera is nearly always mounted on a tripod.
THE MEDIUM-SIZE HAND CAMERA
This type of camera takes sheet film (typical formats of from 2 1/2 × 3 1/2 inches to 4 × 5 inches), roll film, or 70-mm film in interchangeable magazines; it has interchangeable lenses and may have a coupled rangefinder.
Special types use wide-angle lenses and wide picture formats (e.g., 2 1/4 × 4 1/2 to 2 1/4 × 6 3/4 inches [6 × 12 to 6 × 17 centimetres]).
The medium-size hand camera was popular with press photographers in the first half of the 20th century.
Older versions had folding bellows and a lens standard on an extendable baseboard or strut system.
Modern modular designs have a rigid body with interchangeable front and rear units.
THE FOLDING ROLL-FILM CAMERA
The folding roll-film camera, now rare, resembles the 35-mm miniature camera in shutter and viewfinder equipment but has bellows and folds up to pocketable size when not in use.
Generally it takes roll films holding eight to 16 exposures; typical picture sizes are 2 1/4 × 2 1/4, 2 1/4 × 3 1/4, or 1 3/4 × 2 1/4 inches.
Some 35-mm cameras were also produced with bellows.
THE SINGLE-LENS REFLEX
The ground-glass screen at the back of the studio, or view, camera slows down picture taking because the screen must be replaced by the film for an exposure.
The single-lens reflex camera has a screen, but the film remains constantly in position.
A 45° mirror reflects the image-forming rays from the lens onto a screen in the camera top.
The mirror moves out of the way during the exposure and back again afterward for viewing and focusing the next picture.
The image on the screen therefore temporarily disappears from view during the exposure.
Present-day single-lens reflexes are either 35-mm cameras or advanced roll-film models.
Most 35-mm reflexes have optical prism systems for eye-level screen viewing, built-in light-meter and electronic exposure-control systems, interchangeable lenses, and numerous other refinements.
Often the camera is part of an extensive accessory system.
Advanced roll-film reflexes are even more modular, with interchangeable viewfinders, focusing screens, and lenses.
<Caption> The Contax S 35-millimetre SLR camera (1949–51), front, was the first postwar SLR to incorporate a pentaprism.
The Nikon S 36-millimetre SLR camera (1951–55), back, featured range finder focusing.
THE TWIN-LENS REFLEX
The twin-lens reflex is a comparatively bulky dual camera with a fixed-mirror reflex housing and top screen mounted above a roll-film box camera.
Its two lenses focus in unison so that the top screen shows the image sharpness and framing as recorded on the film in the lower section.
The viewing image remains visible all the time, but the viewpoint difference (parallax) of the two lenses means that the framing on the top screen is not exactly identical with that on the film.
SHUTTER AND DIAPHRAGM SYSTEMS
Principal present-day shutters are the leaf shutter and the focal-plane shutter.
THE LEAF SHUTTER
The leaf, or diaphragm, shutter consists of a series of blades or leaves fitted inside or just behind the lens.
The shutter opens by swinging the leaves simultaneously outward to uncover the lens opening.
The leaves stay open for a fixed time - the exposure time - and then close again.
A combination of electromagnets or electromagnets and springs drives the mechanism, while an electronic circuit - often coupled with a light metering system - or an adjustable escapement in mechanical shutters controls the open time.
This is typically between one second and 1/500 second.
FOCAL-PLANE SHUTTER
The focal-plane shutter consists of two light-tight fabric blinds or a combination of metal blinds moving in succession across the film immediately in front of the image plane.
The first blind uncovers the film and the second blind covers it up again, the two blinds forming a traveling slit the width of which determines the exposure time: the narrower the slit, the shorter the time.
The actual travel time is fairly constant for all exposure times.
A mechanism or electromagnet and control circuit triggers the release of the second blind.
Focal-plane shutters are usually adjustable for exposure times between one second (or longer) and 1/1,000 to 1/4,000 second.
DIAPHRAGM AND SHUTTER SETTINGS
In the lens diaphragm a series of leaves increases or decreases the opening to control the light passing through the lens to the film.
The diaphragm control ring carries a scale of so-called f-numbers, or stop numbers, in a series: such as 1.4, 2, 2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11, 16, 22, and 32.
The squares of the f-numbers are inversely proportional to the amount of light admitted.
In the above international standard series, each setting admits twice as much light as the next higher f-number, or stop (giving twice as much exposure).
Shutter settings on present-day cameras also follow a standard double-or-half sequence - e.g.,
1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/15, 1/30, 1/60, 1/125, 1/250, 1/500, 1/1,000 second, and so forth.
The shorter the exposure time, the “faster” the shutter speed.
EXPOSURE VALUES
An attempt to simplify the mathematics of f-number and shutter speed-control functions led to the formulation of exposure values (EV).
These run in a simple whole-number series, each step (EV interval) doubling or halving the effective exposure.
The lower the EV number, the greater the exposure.
Thus, EV 10 gives twice as much exposure as EV 11 or half as much as EV 9.
Each EV value covers a range of aperture/speed combinations of the same equivalent exposure; for instance, f/2.8 with 1/250 second, f/4 with 1/125 second, and f/5.6 with 1/60 second.
For a time some cameras carried an EV scale and coupled the aperture and speed settings; at a given EV setting in such cameras selecting various speeds automatically adjusted the aperture to compensate and vice versa.
Exposure-value setting scales became obsolete with exposure automation, but the notation remains in use to indicate either exposure levels or - at specified film speeds - lighting levels requiring a given exposure.
AUTOMATIC-DIAPHRAGM SYSTEMS
On a camera with a viewing screen (view camera or single-lens reflex) viewing and focusing are carried out with the lens diaphragm fully open, but the exposure is often made at a smaller aperture.
Reflex cameras (and increasingly also view cameras) therefore incorporate a mechanism that automatically or semiautomatically stops down (reduces) the lens to the working aperture immediately before the exposure.
METHODS OF FOCUSING AND FRAMING
The ground-glass (now mostly grained plastic) screen is the most direct way of viewing the image for framing and for sharpness control.
The screen localizes the image plane for observation.
The image is also visible without a screen, but then the eye can locate the image plane of maximum sharpness only with a precisely focused high-power magnifier.
This aerial focusing method avoids interference of the ground-glass structure with sharpness assessment.
FOCUSING AIDS
The eye is not good at recognizing slight unsharpness, so focusing screens (especially in reflex cameras) often incorporate focusing aids such as a split-image wedge alone or with a microprism area, in the screen centre.
The split-image wedge consists of a pair of prism wedges that split an out-of-focus image into two sharp halves laterally displaced relative to one another.
When the lens is correctly focused the image becomes continuous across the wedge area - a point that the eye can assess more precisely.
The microprism area contains several hundred or thousand minute wedges that give a blurred image very ragged outlines and a broken-up texture; these clear abruptly as the image becomes sharp.
The focusing screen is often overlaid by a pattern of fine concentric lens sections.
Called a Fresnel screen, it redirects the light from the screen corners toward the observer’s eye and makes the image evenly bright.
Cameras without a screen generally are equipped with a distance scale, the lens being set to the estimated object distance.
More advanced cameras have an optical rangefinder as a distance-measuring aid; it consists of a viewfinder and a swinging mirror a few inches to one side of the viewfinder axis.
As the eye views an image of the object, the mirror superimposes a second image from a second viewpoint.
On turning the mirror through the correct angle, which depends on the object distance, the two images are made to coincide.
The mirror movement can be linked with a distance scale, or coupled with the lens focusing adjustment.
When the lens is incorrectly focused, the rangefinder shows a double or split image.
In place of a rotating mirror, the rangefinder may use swinging or rotating optical wedges (prisms).
AUTOFOCUS SYSTEMS
Some cameras evaluate the coincidence (or lack thereof) between two rangefinder images by image analysis with a microchip system.
This signals electronically when the lens is set to the correct distance and often carries out the distance setting by a servomotor built into the camera.
Such focusing automation makes the camera even simpler to use.
Alternative automatic ranging systems used in amateur cameras depend on triangulation with infrared rays or pulses sent out by a small light-emitting diode (LED), or on measurement of the time an ultrasonic signal takes to be reflected back from the subject (sonar).
RANGE FINDER
A range finder is any of several instruments used to measure the distance from the instrument to a selected point or object.
One basic type is the optical range finder modeled after a ranging device developed by the Scottish firm of Barr and Stroud in the 1880s.
The optical range finder is usually classified into two kinds, coincidence and stereoscopic.
The coincidence range finder, used chiefly in cameras and for surveying, consists of an arrangement of lenses and prisms set at each end of a tube with a single eyepiece at its centre.
This instrument enables the user to sight an object by correcting the parallax resulting from viewing simultaneously from two slightly separated points.
The object’s range is determined by measuring the angles formed by a line of sight at each end of the tube; the smaller the angles produced, the greater is the distance, and vice versa.
The stereoscopic range finder operates on much the same principle and resembles the coincidence type except that it has two eyepieces instead of one.
The design of the stereoscopic instrument makes it more effective for sighting moving objects.
It was widely used for land-gunnery ranging during World War II.
Since the mid-1940s, radar has supplanted optical range finders for most military target-ranging operations.
This nonoptical ranging device determines the distance to a target by measuring the time it takes radio pulses to reach the object, bounce off, and return.
Advances in laser technology led to the development in 1965 of another kind of ranging instrument known as the laser range finder.
It has largely replaced coincidence range finders for surveying and radar in certain military applications.
The laser range finder, like radar, measures distance by timing the interval between the transmission and reception of electromagnetic waves, but it employs visible or infrared light rather than radio pulses.
Such a device can measure distances of up to 1 mile (1.61 km) to an accuracy of 0.2 inch (0.5 cm).
It is especially useful in surveying rough terrain where remote points have to be located between rocks and brush.
While these devices measure distance automatically, single-lens reflex cameras may incorporate electronic image-analysis systems to measure sharpness.
The signal output of such systems actuates red or green LEDs in the camera finder system to show whether the image is sharp or not.
The same signal can control a servomotor in the lens for fully automatic focusing.
These devices are limited at low lighting and contrast levels - where the human eye also finds sharpness assessment difficult.
VIEWFINDERS
The sighting devices in cameras lacking screens are called viewfinders; they show how much of the scene will appear on the film.
The simplest viewfinder is a wire frame above the camera front, with a second frame near the back to aid the eye in correct centring.
Most present-day finders are built into the camera and are compact lens systems.
Bright-frame finders show a white frame reflected into the view to outline the field recorded on the film.
An alternative form is the reflecting viewfinder in which the photographer looks down into a field lens on top of the camera.
The upper section of a twin-lens reflex camera is such a reflecting finder.
As the viewfinder axis in a camera other than a single-lens reflex does not usually coincide with the lens axis, the finder’s and the lens’s views do not exactly match.
This parallax error is insignificant with distant subjects; with near ones it is responsible for the familiar fault of a portrait shot of a head that appears partly cut off in the picture even though it was fully visible in the finder.
Camera viewfinders may have parallax-compensating devices.
The optical finder gives a direct upright and right-reading view of the subject with the camera held at eye level.
The traditional reflex camera, held at waist level, showed a laterally reversed view.
Modern reflexes have a pentaprism arrangement that permits upright, right-reading, eye-level viewing by redirecting the image from the horizontal screen on top of the camera.
EXPOSURE-METERING SYSTEMS
Exposure meters, or light meters, measure the light in a scene to establish optimum camera settings for correct exposures.
A light-sensitive cell generates or controls an electric current according to the amount of light reaching the cell.
The current may energize a microammeter or circuit controlling LEDs to indicate exposure settings.
In most modern cameras the current or signal acts on a microprocessor or other circuit that directly sets the shutter speed or lens aperture.
The cell usually is a silicon or other photodiode generating a current that is then amplified.
In older cadmium sulfide cells the light falling on the cell changed the latter’s resistance to a current passing through it.
Selenium cells, still used in some cameras, also generate a current but are larger and less sensitive.
Single-lens reflex cameras have one or more photocells fitted in the pentaprism housing to measure the brightness of the screen image.
The exposure reading depends on the light coming through the lens (TTL metering) and so allows for the lens’s angle of view, close-up exposure corrections, stray light, and other factors.
Some TTL systems divert the light from the lens to a photocell before it reaches the screen (e.g., by beam-splitting arrangements or the use of photocells behind a partly reflecting mirror), or they measure the light reflected from the film or from a specially structured first shutter blind at the beginning of, or during, the exposure.
Such off-the-film (OTF) measurement is also used for electronic flash control.
View cameras may use a photocell on a probe that can be moved to any point just in front of the focusing screen, thus measuring image brightness at selected points of the image plane.
This takes place before the exposure, and the probe is then moved out of the way.
Professional photographers also use hand-held separate exposure meters and transfer the readings manually to the camera.
AN EXPOSURE METER
An exposure meter (also called a light meter) measures the intensity of light and indicates proper exposure (i.e., the combination of aperture and shutter speed) for film or image sensors of a specific sensitivity.
Traditional exposure meters are separate handheld devices, though almost every modern camera, both film and digital, comes with a built-in meter.
Older light meters were of the self-generating, or photovoltaic, type, in which a selenium element converted the incoming light directly into an electric current.
A microammeter measured this current and was calibrated to indicate the intensity of the light.
Exposure was then set by adjusting dials to control aperture opening and shutter speed, taking into consideration the specific sensitivity of the film.
Selenium cells had to be relatively large in order to display adequate sensitivity to light, and eventually they were abandoned in favour of instruments of the variable resistance, or photoconductive, type.
In those meters the light-sensitive element, sometimes a cadmium sulfide cell but most often consisting of silicon photodiodes, is connected to a battery-powered circuit and changes its electrical resistance with variations in the light intensity.
The change in current is measured by a milliammeter calibrated to read light intensity.
Hand-held meters measure incident light (light that illuminates the subject of the photography) as well as reflected light (light reflected from the subject and picked up by the camera).
Qualities of light other than intensity can be measured, such as colour composition.
Some sensors are capable of scanning a small spot, and some can be used to measure the intensity of flashes.
A light meter measures the amount of light in the area and the result is used in setting the camera before clicking the picture.
Exposure meters incorporated into cameras measure reflected but not incident light.
In some meters, the light-sensitive element is set on the exterior of the camera, but in other cameras, particularly single-lens reflex (SLR) cameras, they are set internally.
The latter meters are of the “through-the-lens” (TTL) type, reading light as it is focused by the camera’s lens and strikes the film or sensor.
Many of the capabilities of handheld meters are found in built-in meters.
Exposure correction can be done either semiautomatically or automatically.
In a semiautomatic model, the operator adjusts the aperture and shutter speed until the camera’s display indicates a correct exposure.
In fully automatic cameras, the exposure is corrected by the camera mechanism itself.
FLASH SYSTEMS
Flash is a widely used artificial light source for photography, providing a reproducible light of high intensity and short duration.
It can be synchronized with an instantaneous exposure.
Being battery powered, small flash units are self-contained.
ELECTRONIC FLASH
The most common flash system depends on a high-voltage discharge through a gas-filled tube.
A capacitor charged to several hundred volts (by a step-up circuit from low-voltage batteries or from the line voltage supply) provides the discharge energy.
A low-voltage circuit generating a high-voltage pulse triggers the flash, which lasts typically 1/1,000 second or less.
Small electronic flash units may be built into or clipped onto the camera.
Larger units are attached with brackets.
Large professional units with floodlight and spotlight fittings are used in studio photography.
Even small flashes often have adjustable reflectors, for example, to illuminate an indoor subject by the flash reflected from the ceiling or walls.
AUTOMATIC AND DEDICATED FLASH
Electronic flash units often incorporate a fast-responding photodiode that cumulatively measures the light reflected from the subject and switches off the flash when that light has reached a preselected amount (computer flash).
This flash-duration control thus adjusts the flash exposure automatically as long as the subject is within a certain distance range (typically from two to 20 feet [from 0.61 to 6.1 metres]).
At lower power or near subject distances the duration of a computer flash may drop to 1/50,000 second.
With certain camera–flash combinations OTF metering inside the camera can control the flash duration by suitable contacts made when the flash is attached to the camera.
These “dedicated” flashes (so named because their control circuitry has to match that of specific cameras) may also signal in the camera finder when the flash is ready to operate and to set the camera automatically to its synchronizing shutter speed.
HAROLD E. EDGERTON
Harold E. Edgerton (1903–1990) was an American electrical engineer and photographer who was noted for creating high-speed photography techniques that he applied to scientific uses.
Edgerton earned a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from the University of Nebraska in 1925 and received master’s (1927) and doctoral (1931) degrees in the same field from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge.
He taught at MIT from 1928, becoming a full professor there in 1948.
In 1926, as a graduate student, Edgerton began to experiment with flash tubes.
He developed a tube using xenon gas that could produce high-intensity bursts of light as short as 1/1,000,000 second.
Edgerton’s tube remains the basic flash device used in still photography.
The xenon flash could also emit repeated bursts of light at regular and very brief intervals and was thus an ideal stroboscope.
With his new flash Edgerton was able to photograph the action of such things as drops of milk falling into a saucer, a tennis racket hitting a ball, and bullets hitting a steel plate or traveling at speeds of up to 2,800 feet (853 metres) per second.
The resulting images often possessed artistic beauty in addition to their value to industry and science.
Edgerton explored many uses for his new photographic equipment.
During World War II he constructed stroboscopic units to photograph the night operations of enemy troops.
After the war he and his associates photographed nuclear test explosions.
He later devised methods and equipment to photograph sea life at unprecedented depths.
FLASHBULBS
An older type of flash is an oxygen-filled glass envelope containing a specific amount of aluminum or zirconium wire and means for igniting the wire in the bulb.
The wire burns away with a brilliant flash lasting typically about 1/100 to 1/50 second.
Each flashbulb can, however, yield only one flash.
Current flashbulb systems use four to 10 tiny bulbs, each in its own reflector, arranged in cube or bar carriers that plug into cameras designed for them.
The individual flashes are fired in turn by a battery and circuit in the camera through mechanically generated current pulses or other means.
In view of the greater convenience of electronic flash, flashbulbs in their various forms are largely obsolescent.
FIRING AND SYNCHRONIZATION
Flash units are usually fired with a switch in the camera shutter to synchronize the flash with the shutter opening.
A contact in the camera’s flash shoe (hot shoe) or a flash lead connects the unit with this shutter switch.
The shutter contact usually closes the instant the shutter is opened.
A focal plane shutter must fully uncover the film (generally at a shutter speed of 1/60 second or slower) for flash synchronization.
With flashbulbs the shutter must also stay open while the flash reaches its peak brightness - about 1/50 second.
SYSTEM CAMERAS
From the development of the 35-mm miniature camera in the 1930s evolved the concept of the system camera that could be adapted to numerous jobs with a range of interchangeable components and specialized accessories.
Today, most moderately advanced 35-mm miniatures take interchangeable lenses, close-up and photomicrographic attachments, filters, flash units, and other accessories.
The most elaborate camera systems also include such accessories as alternative finder systems; interchangeable reflex screens, film backs, and magazines; and remote-control and motor-drive systems.
Modular professional roll-film and view cameras are built up from a selection of alternative camera bodies, film backs, bellows units, lenses, and shutters.
This is the nearest approach to the universal camera, assembled as required to deal with practically every type of photography.
CHARACTERISTICS AND PARAMETERS OF LENSES
The lens forming an image in the camera is a converging lens, the simplest form of which is a single biconvex (lentil-shaped) element.
In theory such a lens makes a light beam of parallel rays converge to a point (the focus) behind the lens.
The distance of this focus from the lens itself is the focal length, which depends on the curvature of the lens surfaces and the optical properties of the lens glass.
An object at a very long distance (optically regarded as at “infinity”) in front of the lens forms an inverted image in a plane (the focal plane) going through the focus.
Light rays from nearer objects form an image in a plane behind the focal plane.
The nearer the object, the farther behind the lens the corresponding image plane is located - which is why a lens has to be focused to get sharp images of objects at different distances.
FOCAL LENGTH AND IMAGE SCALE
The image scale, or scale of reproduction, is the ratio of the image size to the object size; it is often quoted as a magnification.
When the image is smaller than the object, the magnification of the object is less than 1.0.
If the image is 1/20 the size of the object, for example, the magnification may be expressed either as 0.05 or as 1:20.
For an object at a given distance, the scale of the image depends on the focal length of the lens.
A normal camera lens usually has a focal length approximately equal to the diagonal of the picture format covered.
A lens of longer focal length gives a larger scale image but necessarily covers less of the scene in front of the camera.
Conversely, a lens of shorter focal length yields an image on a smaller scale but - provided the angle of coverage is sufficient - takes in more of the scene.
Many cameras, therefore, can be fitted with interchangeable lenses of different focal lengths to allow varying the image scale and field covered.
The focal length of a lens in millimetres (sometimes in inches) is generally engraved on the lens mount.
APERTURE
The aperture, or f-number, is the ratio of the focal length to the diameter of an incident light beam as it reaches the lens.
For instance, if the focal length is 50 millimetres and the diameter of the incident light beam is 25 millimetres, the f-number is 2.
This incident-beam diameter is often roughly the lens-diaphragm diameter, but it may be appreciably larger or smaller.
The maximum aperture (f-number at the largest diaphragm opening) is also marked on the lens, usually in the form f:2, f/2, or 1:2.
ANGLE OF COVERAGE
A lens must cover the area of a camera’s film format to yield an image adequately sharp and with reasonably even brightness from the centre to the corners of the film.
A normal lens should cover an angle of at least 60°.
A wide-angle lens covers a greater angle - about 70° to 90° or more for an ultrawide-angle lens.
A long-focus lens covers a smaller angle.
The angle of coverage depends on the lens design.
Designations like “wide angle” or “narrow angle” are not necessarily synonymous with “short focus” and “long focus,” as the latter terms refer to the focal length of the lens relative to the picture format.
OPTICAL PERFORMANCE
A simple lens produces a very imperfect image, which is usually blurred away from the centre.
The image may have colour fringes around object outlines, and straight lines may be distorted.
Such defects, called aberrations, can be eliminated - and even then not completely - only by replacing the single lens element by a group of elements of appropriate shape and separation.
Aberrations arising from some of the lens elements then counteract opposite aberrations produced by other elements.
The larger the maximum aperture, the greater the angle of coverage, and the higher the degree of correction aimed at, the more complex camera lenses become.
Lens design for relative freedom from aberrations involves advanced computer programming to calculate the geometric parameters of every lens element.
Some aberrations can also be corrected by making one or more of the surfaces of a lens system aspheric; i.e., with the variable curvature of a paraboloid or other surface rather than the constant curvature of a spherical one.
Lenses usually consist of optical glass.
Transparent plastics also have come into use, especially as they can be molded into elements with aspheric surfaces.
They are, however, more sensitive to mechanical damage.
ABERRATIONS
There are a number of lens aberrations, each with its own characteristics.
Chromatic aberration is present when the lens forms images by different-coloured light in different planes and at different scales.
Colour-corrected lenses largely eliminate these faults.
Spherical aberration is present when the outer parts of a lens do not bring light rays into the same focus as the central part.
Images formed by the lens at large apertures are therefore unsharp but get sharper at smaller apertures.
Curvature of field is present when the sharpest image is formed not on a flat plane but on a curved surface.
Astigmatism occurs when the lens fails to focus image lines running in different directions in the same plane; in a picture of a rail fence, for instance, the vertical posts are sharp at a focus setting different from the horizontal rails.
Another aberration, called coma, makes image points near the edges of the film appear as irregular, unsharp shapes.
Distortion is present when straight lines running parallel with the picture edges appear to bow outward (barrel distortion) or inward (pincushion distortion).
CHROMATIC ABERRATION
Chromatic aberration is a colour distortion in an image viewed through a glass lens.
Because the refractive index of glass varies with wavelength, every property of a lens that depends on its refractive index also varies with wavelength, including the focal length, the image distance, and the image magnification.
The change of image distance with wavelength is known as chromatic aberration, and the variation of magnification with wavelength is known as chromatic difference of magnification, or lateral colour.
Chromatic aberration can be eliminated by combining a strong lens of low-dispersion (crown) glass with a weaker lens made of high-dispersion (flint) glass.
Such a combination is said to be achromatic.
This method of removing chromatic aberration was discovered in 1729 by Chester Hall, an English inventor, and it was exploited vigorously in the late 18th century in numerous small telescopes.
Chromatic variation of magnification can be eliminated by achromatizing all the components of a system or by making the system symmetrical about a central diaphragm.
Both chromatic aberration and lateral colour are corrected in every high-grade optical system.
In chromatic aberration, different wavelengths of light have different focal points.
RESOLVING POWER AND CONTRAST-TRANSFER FUNCTION
One way of testing lens performance is to observe the image it forms of patterns of increasingly closely spaced black lines separated by white spaces of line width.
The closest spacing still recognizable in the image gives a resolving power value, expressed in line pairs (i.e., black line plus white space) per millimetre.
Photographs of such line patterns, or test targets, show the resolving power of the lens and film combination.
For example, a resolution of 80–100 line pairs per millimetre on a fine-grain film represents very good performance for a normal miniature camera lens.
The visual sharpness of an image depends also on its contrast.
Opticians, therefore, often plot the contrast with which the image is reproduced against the line spacing of that image.
The resulting contrast-transfer curve, or function, gives a more reliable indication of the lens performance under practical picture-taking conditions.
SPECIAL LENS TYPES
Apart from general-purpose camera lenses of various focal lengths, there are lenses of special characteristics or design.
TELEPHOTO LENSES
Long-focus lenses are bulky, because they comprise not only the lens itself but also a mount or tube to hold it at the appropriate focal distance from the film.
Telephoto lenses are more compact; their combinations of lens groups make the back focus (the distance from the rear lens element to the film) as well as the length of the whole lens appreciably shorter than the focal length.
Strictly, the term telephoto applies only to a lens of this optically reduced length; in practice long-focus lenses of all types tend to be called indiscriminately telephoto or “tele” lenses.
If a camera lens is interchangeable, an accessory teleconverter lens group can be positioned between the prime lens and the camera.
This turns a normal lens into an even more compact telephoto system, which is less costly than a telephoto lens but which reduces the speed of the prime lens and usually impairs sharpness performance.
WIDE-ANGLE AND RETROFOCUS LENSES
Short-focus, wide-angle lenses are usually mounted near the film.
Single-lens reflex cameras need a certain minimum lens-to-film distance to accommodate the swinging mirror.
Wide-angle (and sometimes normal-focus) lenses for such cameras therefore use retrofocus designs.
In these the back focus is appreciably longer than the focal length.
Both a telephoto and a retrofocus lens must be specially designed for its particular use to ensure optimum image performance.
FISH-EYE LENSES
For image angles greater than 110°, it becomes difficult to bring the lens close enough to the film to allow the rays between the lens and film to diverge sufficiently.
The fish-eye lens overcomes this difficulty by making the rays diverge less behind the lens than they do in front.
The resulting image shows appreciable distortion, with image details near the edges and corners progressively compressed.
Fish-eye lenses usually cover angles between 140° and 210° and are used for unusual wide-angle effects where the distortion becomes a deliberate pictorial element.
They also have certain scientific applications, for instance, to cover a horizon-to-horizon view of the sky in recording cloud formations.
MIRROR LENSES
Images can also be formed by light reflected from curved mirrors.
This method, long used in astronomical telescopes, is applied to long-focus lens systems of short overall length by folding the light path back onto itself.
A mirror lens or catadioptric system has no chromatic aberrations.
Other aberrations are corrected by incorporating one or more appropriate lens elements.
The arrangement of the system, with a central opening in the primary mirror, makes stopping down with a customary diaphragm difficult, and neutral-density filters are used to control light transmission.
VARIABLE-FOCUS LENSES
In variable-focus lenses the focal length can be varied by movement of some of the elements or groups within the lens system.
One lens can thus replace a range of interchangeable lenses.
The variable-focus, or zoom, lens was originally developed for motion-picture photography, in which adjustment of the focal length during a shot produced a zooming-in or zooming-out effect (hence the name).
It is now widely used in single-lens reflex cameras where the reflex finder permits accurate continuous assessment of image coverage.
In a true zoom lens the image changes in scale but not in sharpness during zooming; some varifocal lenses, however, need refocusing at different focal lengths.
Due to correction requirements over a range of focal lengths, zoom lenses are complex systems containing from 12 to 20 elements.
Zoom lenses for still cameras have focal-length ratios from 2:1 to 4:1 or more (e.g., 35–135 mm for a 35-mm reflex).
LENS-CHANGING SYSTEMS
Miniature and roll-film cameras hold interchangeable lenses in screw or quick-change bayonet mounts.
In a focal-plane shutter camera the usable range of focal lengths is practically unlimited.
In cameras with leaf shutters, either the lens is mounted in front of the shutter or the lens is changed with the shutter.
Some designs use convertible lenses with the rear components built into the camera together with the shutter; interchangeable front groups then provide different focal lengths in combination with the fixed rear group.
View-camera lenses - usually with their own shutters - are mounted on lens boards that clip into and out of the front camera standard.
Afocal attachments provide the effect of alternative focal lengths with a fixed camera lens.
They are magnifying or reducing telescopes without a focal length (hence afocal), yielding a virtual image that the camera lens projects onto the film.
Their designated magnification factor indicates the effect on the image scale; e.g., a 1.5× tele attachment magnifies the image on the film 1 1/2 times, while a 0.7× wide-angle attachment reduces the image scale to 0.7 times that of the prime camera lens.
LENS COATING
When light passes from one optical medium to another (especially from air to glass and vice versa in a lens), about 4 to 8 percent of it is lost by reflection at the interface.
This light loss builds up appreciably in complex multielement lenses.
Some of the reflected light still reaches the film as ghost images or light spots or as general contrast-reducing scattered light.
To reduce such losses, the air-to-glass surfaces of modern lenses typically carry a microscopically thin coating of metallic fluorides.
The coating eliminates most reflected rays.
Complete elimination can occur only for light of one wavelength if the coating thickness and refractive index are exactly right.
In practice a coated lens surface reflects about 0.5 percent of incident white light - 1/10 of the light lost by an uncoated lens.
Multiple coatings can reduce reflections over a wider wavelength range.
CHAPTER TWO
BLACK-AND-WHITE FILMS
Film is the basic material of photography.
It consists of light-sensitive emulsion - microscopic crystals of silver halide suspended in gelatin - that is coated onto a flexible support of plastic.
Virtually all black-and-white films for general use are panchromatic - equally sensitive (or approximately so) to the light of all colours.
The monochromatic tonal values of a subject photographed on panchromatic film will match those of the subject quite closely.
THE LATENT IMAGE
The sensitive surface of ordinary film is a layer of gelatin carrying minute suspended silver halide crystals or grains (the emulsion) - typically silver bromide with some silver iodide.
Exposure to light in a camera produces an invisible change yielding a latent image, distinguishable from unexposed silver halide only by its ability to be reduced to metallic silver by certain developing agents.
Current theories postulate that silver halide crystals carry minute specks of metallic silver - so-called sensitivity specks - which amount in mass to about 1/100,000,000 part of the silver halide crystal.
A silver halide is a compound of silver with fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine, but only the last three are light-sensitive.
When light action releases electrons from the silver halide crystal, they migrate to the sensitivity specks.
The resulting electric charge on the specks attracts silver ions from the neighbouring silver halide; and as the silver ions accumulate, they become metallic silver, causing the speck to grow.
Halogen (e.g., bromine) atoms at the same time migrate to the surface of the silver halide crystal and are there absorbed by the gelatin of the emulsion.
When the sensitivity speck is large enough, it provides a point of attack for the developer, which can then reduce the whole silver halide crystal to silver.
Developers are selective organic reducing agents that attack only silver halide crystals that have sufficiently large sensitivity specks.
The halide grains carrying a developable sensitivity speck make up the latent image.
SENSITOMETRY AND SPEED
The sensitivity or speed of a film determines how much light it needs to produce a given amount of silver on development.
Sensitometry is the science of measuring this sensitivity, which is determined by giving the material a series of graduated exposures in an appropriate instrument (the sensitometer).
After development under specified conditions, the density of the silver deposit produced by each exposure is measured and the densities are plotted on a graph against the logarithm of the exposure.
The resulting characteristic curve, or D/log E curve, shows how the film reacts to exposure changes.
A specified point on the curve also serves as a criterion for calculating film speed by methods laid down in various national and international standards.
The internationally adopted scale is ISO speed, written, for example, 200/24°.
The first half of this (200) is arithmetic with the value directly proportional to the sensitivity (and also identical with the still widely used ASA speed).
The second half (24°) is logarithmic, increasing by 3° for every doubling of the speed (and matching the DIN speeds still used in parts of Europe).
A film of 200/24° ISO is twice as fast (and for a given subject requires half as much exposure) as a film of 100/21° ISO, or half as fast as a film of 400/27° ISO.
All-around films for outdoor and some indoor photography have speeds between 80/20° and 200/24° ISO; fine-grain films for maximum image definition between 25/15° and 64/19° ISO; and high-speed and ultraspeed films for poor lighting conditions, ranged from from 400/27° to 3200/36° ISO.
Typical low-light consumer film speeds tend to top out at around 800/40° ISO.
COLOUR SENSITIVITY
Initially, the silver halide emulsion is sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and to violet and blue light.
Most films contain sensitizing dyes to extend their colour sensitivity through the whole visible spectrum.
Such films, called panchromatic films, were introduced in 1904.
They record subject colour values as gray tones largely corresponding to the visual brightness of the colours.
Non-colour-sensitized or blue-sensitive emulsions (without sensitizing dyes) are used for copying monochrome originals and similar applications needing no extended colour sensitivity.
At one time orthochromatic films - sensitive to violet, blue, green, and yellow but not to red - were also used for general photography; now they are employed mainly for photographing of phosphor screens, such as cathode-ray tubes, and for other purposes requiring green but not red sensitivity.
Infrared films, developed in 1919, are sensitized to invisible infrared wavelengths.
They are used in aerial photography to cut through atmospheric haze (which scatters blue light but not infrared rays) and for special purposes in scientific and forensic photography.
FILTERS
Filters can modify the way in which a film records colours as monochrome tone values.
They are disks of coloured glass or gelatin with controlled transmission characteristics.
Placed in front of the camera lens, they preferentially transmit light of their own colour and hold back light of other colours.
A yellow or yellow-green filter is often used in landscape photography to prevent overexposure of the blue sky and to bring out detail in cloud formations.
Orange and red filters make the sky still darker and cut through haze by absorbing scattered blue light.
<Caption> Yellow, green, and red filters for an SLR camera lens can improve various colours and reduce reflections in challenging lighting conditions.
Contrast filters differentiate between the gray values of objects of different colour but of similar brightness.
For instance, a red flower and green foliage record in similar shades of mid-gray.
A red filter holds back green light to darken the green foliage, making the flower lighter; a green filter absorbs red light, thus darkening the flower.
Such deliberate tone distortion is widely used in photomicrography and other fields.
Other filter types used in photography include ultraviolet, infrared, and polarizing filters.
Ultraviolet-absorbing filters screen out ultraviolet rays at high altitudes (e.g., in mountain photography).
Because camera lenses are not normally corrected for such rays, the rays can reduce image sharpness, even though the lenses allow only a small amount of ultraviolet to be transmitted.
Infrared filters are used with infrared film to hold back visible light.
Polarizing filters polarize light and can absorb polarized light if suitably oriented.
Light reflected at certain angles from shiny surfaces of nonmetallic media (glass, water, varnish) is polarized; a properly oriented polarizing filter subdues such reflections in a picture.
Because a filter screens out part of the light, its use calls for extra exposure, the amount of which is indicated by a filter factor - e.g.,
2×, which means the exposure time must be multiplied by 2.
For cameras with an exposure-value scale, a filter may specify an exposure value reduction (such as -1 or -1 1/2; i.e., the indicated exposure value must be reduced by this amount).
The factor of a given filter depends on the spectral sensitivity of the film, the colour quality of the lighting, the type of subject, the effect aimed at, and other exposure conditions.
PHOTOGRAPHIC FILTER
A photographic filter is a device used to selectively modify the component wavelengths of mixed (e.g., white) light before it strikes the film.
Filters may be made of coloured glass, plastic, gelatin, or sometimes a coloured liquid in a glass cell.
They are most often placed over the camera lens but can in some cases be placed over the light source with the same effect.
Black-and-white films are imperfect in their colour sensitivity, and coloured filters are used to modify the light and translate the subject into gray tones that correspond to the tones seen by the human eye.
Coloured filters can also brighten or darken the reproduction of coloured objects, permitting local contrast controls at the point of exposure.
In colour photography, coloured filters are used to alter the colour quality of the light to match the colour sensitivity of the film.
Some light filters are used in both colour and black-and-white photography.
Neutral density filters decrease the intensity of the light without affecting its colour and are used when the light intensity is too great for the correct exposure.
Polarizing filters enhance colour vividness by reducing glare from the reflecting surfaces of such substances as glass and water.
Colour filters are also used for colour correction in the printing process and for selecting contrast scales of multicontrast black-and-white enlarging paper.
Since filters absorb some of the light that passes through them, an increase in the calculated exposure is usually required.
This increase is known as the filter factor.
Modern cameras with built-in meters measure the light after the filtration and thus take the decrease in intensity into account.
OTHER FILM CHARACTERISTICS
Of practical interest to the photographer are the graininess, resolving power, and contrast of a film.
Although they are characteristics of the film itself, they are influenced by the conditions of development.
GRAIN
The image derived from minute silver halide crystals is discontinuous in structure.
This gives an appearance of graininess in big enlargements.
The effect is most prominent with fast films, which have comparatively large silver halide crystals.
RESOLVING POWER AND ACUTANCE
The fineness of detail that a film can resolve depends not only on its graininess but also on the light scatter or irradiation within the emulsion (which tends to spread image details) and on the contrast with which the film reproduces fine detail.
These effects can be measured physically to give an acutance value, which is preferred to resolving power as a criterion of a film’s sharpness performance.
Fine-grain films with thin emulsions yield the highest acutance.
CONTRAST
High-contrast films reproduce tone differences in the subject as great density differences in the image; low-contrast films translate tone differences into small density differences.
The characteristic curve of a film obtained by plotting the density against the logarithm of the exposure can be used to express a film’s contrast.
The slope of the straight-line section of the curve (sometimes called the gamma, actually the tangent of the angle α) indicates contrast: the steeper the slope, the higher the contrast rendering.
General-purpose films yield medium contrast (gamma 0.7 to 1).
High-contrast films (gamma 1.5 to 10) are used for copying line originals and other specialized purposes; low-contrast films for continuous-tone reproduction.
Gamma is also used to indicate degree of development, since increased development generally results in a higher gamma.
FILM STRUCTURE AND FORMS
Film consists of a number of layers and components: (1) A supercoat of gelatin, a few micrometres (one micrometre is 0.001 millimetre) thick, protects the emulsion from scratches and abrasion marks. (
Pressure and rubbing can produce developable silver densities.) (
2) The emulsion layer (silver halide suspended in gelatin) is usually nine to 12 micrometres (up to 1/2,000 inch) thick but may sometimes reach 25 micrometres. (
3) A substrate or subbing layer promotes adhesion of the emulsion to the film base. (
4) The film base, or support, is usually cellulose triacetate or a related polymer.
The thickness may range from 0.08 to 0.2 millimetre (0.003 to 0.008 inch).
Films for graphic arts and scientific purposes are often coated on a polyethylene terephthalate or other polyester support of high dimensional stability.
Glass plates - once the most common support for negative materials - are now used only for applications requiring extreme emulsion flatness. (
5) A backing layer on the rear of the film base counteracts curling.
Usually it contains also a nearly opaque dye to suppress light reflection on the rear support surface.
Such reflection (halation) reduces definition by causing halolike effects around very bright image points.
Some film bases (especially in 35-mm films) are tinted gray to absorb light that has passed through the emulsion layer.
SHEET FILM
View and studio cameras generally take sheet film - single sheets (typical sizes range between 2 1/2 × 3 1/2 and 8 × 10 inches) loaded in the darkroom into light-tight film holders for subsequent insertion in the camera.
ROLL FILM
The term roll film is usually reserved for film wound up on a spool with an interleaving light-tight backing paper to protect the wound-up film.
The spool is loaded into the camera in daylight, the backing paper leader threaded to a second spool, and the film wound from picture to picture once the camera is closed.
This is the classical roll film of roll-film cameras.
Common current film widths are 62 mm and 45 mm.
The rear of the backing paper carries sets of consecutive numbers spaced at frame intervals for different image formats.
In some roll-film cameras these numbers are visible through a viewing window in the camera and show how far the film must be wound to advance it from one picture to the next.
Instant-loading cartridges also use paper-backed roll film.
<Caption> An opened back of a 35-mm camera reveals a loaded roll of film that is perforated and uses a transport sprocket to draw the film from a cartridge onto another spool as it advances from picture to picture.
PERFORATED FILM
Some film is perforated along its edges and rolled up on its own inside a light-tight cartridge, which can be loaded into the camera in daylight.
Once the camera is closed, a transport sprocket engaging the edge perforations draws the film from the cartridge onto a spool and advances it from picture to picture.
The most common film width is 35 mm (for 35-mm miniature cameras), and its cartridge typically holds enough film for up to 36 (sometimes 72) exposures.
A 70-mm film for larger cameras and 16-mm strips for ultraminiatures are packed and used in a similar way.
In March 1983 the Eastman Kodak Company announced the development of a new coding system for 35-mm film and cartridges.
The DX film system employs optical, electrical, and mechanical encoding to transmit to appropriately equipped cameras such information as film type, film speed, and number of exposures.
The system also supplies data that enable automatic photofinishing equipment to identify and sort film quickly, simplifying processing and printing.
In the interest of uniformity, Kodak freely offered the DX system to all film and camera manufacturers, and within two years it was generally adopted.
EASTMAN KODAK COMPANY
Eastman Kodak Company, also called Kodak, is an American manufacturer of film and photographic supplies and provider of digital imaging services and products.
The company’s headquarters are in Rochester, New York.
The company was incorporated in 1901 as the successor to a business established in Rochester in 1880 by George Eastman, who perfected the newly developed method of making photographic dry plates.
Before 1880, photographers had to coat a plate with fresh, wet chemicals each time they wanted to take a picture.
Eastman developed a machine that mechanically produced dry, precoated plates, and he set up the company that later would become Eastman Kodak to sell his plates.
Four years later Eastman introduced roll film, and in 1888 he introduced the Kodak camera, the first camera that was simple and portable enough to be used by large numbers of amateur photographers.
The camera was sold with film sealed inside, and the whole unit was mailed back to Rochester for film processing and replacement.
In 1900 Eastman introduced the less-expensive Brownie, a simple box camera with a removable film container, so that the whole unit no longer needed to be sent back to the plant.
In following years the company continued to produce innovations for the amateur photographer.
Kodak was the first to make home-movie equipment and an easy-to-use colour slide film, Kodachrome.
In the 1960s the company introduced the Instamatic series of still and movie cameras, all of which used cartridge-loaded film.
The first digital camera was invented in 1975 by a Kodak employee, but the technology was not developed at that time.
The Disc camera series, introduced in 1982, was a technologically advanced group of cameras that could automatically activate the use of the flash, if necessary, in addition to adjusting the focus and advancing the film.
In 1984 the company entered the video market by introducing an 8-millimetre video camera system and videocassette tapes.
By the early 21st century, facing significant declines in the consumer market for cameras and other products related to film photography, Kodak placed new emphasis on digital photography products.
The company remained a leading supplier of photographic films, papers, and chemicals for professional photographers and also manufactured motion-picture film, single-use and other consumer digital cameras, aerial surveillance films, and equipment for the graphic communications industry into the 21st century.
Kodak filed for bankruptcy in January 2012 and announced soon after that it would no longer manufacture digital cameras and some other digital imaging products.
DISK FILM
Some compact mass-market cameras took circular disks of film, 65 millimetres in diameter, in light-tight cartridges and coated on a 0.18-mm polyester base.
In the camera the disk rotated as up to 15 exposures (frame size 8 × 10 millimetres) were recorded around the disk circumference.
The disk laid flatter in the camera than rolled-up film and was suitable for more automated photofinishing; the high printing magnification required, however, limited the image quality.
CHAPTER THREE
PICTURE-TAKING TECHNIQUE
The main areas of practical camera handling in photography concern sharpness control, exposure, and lighting.
SHARPNESS CONTROL
The image on the film is sharpest when the lens is focused to the exact object distance.
Usually, however, a scene includes objects at varying distances from the camera.
Various factors affect the sharpness distribution in a picture of such a scene.
DEPTH OF FIELD
The sharpness in the image of objects in front of and behind the focused distance falls off gradually.
Within a certain range of object distances this sharpness loss is still comparatively unnoticeable.
This range is the depth of field and depends on: (1) the amount of sharpness loss regarded as acceptable: miniature negatives requiring big enlargement must be sharper than larger format negatives, which are enlarged less; (2) the lens aperture used: stopping down the lens (higher f-numbers) increases the depth of field; (3) the object distance: the depth of field is smaller for near objects than for more distant ones; and (4) the focal length of the lens: depth of field is reduced with longer focus lenses (and with larger picture formats requiring lenses of longer focal length), and the depth increases with shorter focus lenses.
A depth of field indicator, often included on the focusing mounts of lenses, shows on the distance scale how far in front of and behind the focused distance objects will be in focus at different diaphragm openings.
<Caption> Depth of field is greater when the lens aperture is smaller.
In a scene of great depth the use of an aperture of f 2, for example, allows either foreground subjects (left) or background subjects (right) to be brought into focus, but not both.
SUBJECT AND CAMERA MOVEMENT
Movement of the subject while the camera shutter is open for the exposure leads to a blurred image.
The exposure time must therefore be short enough to keep the blur within acceptable limits.
The shutter speed required depends on the movement speed of the object, the scale of the image (movement blur becomes greater the nearer the subject or the longer the focal length of the lens used) and the movement direction; movement across the direction of view produces the most blurring.
Movement blur can be reduced, even with comparatively slow shutter speeds, by moving the camera (panning) to follow the subject during the exposure.
This records the moving object comparatively sharply against a blurred background and emphasizes the impression of speed.
Camera shake through unsteady support during the exposure also creates image blur - over the whole picture in such cases.
Hand-held shots generally demand shutter speeds of 1/30 second or shorter.
For longer times a firm camera support - such as a tripod - is essential.
EXPOSURE TECHNIQUE
The correct exposure (aperture and shutter settings) can be derived from tables or calculators or by direct measurement of the subject luminance with a light meter.
AUTOMATIC METER CONTROL
Cameras with through-the-lens (TTL) exposure meters - and also hand-held meters pointed at the subject - measure the average reflected light intensity, yielding reliable exposures for subjects of average contrast and brightness distribution.
Subjects of extreme contrast or very bright or dark dominant areas need overriding exposure corrections; automatic cameras often have provision for this.
Such a TTL measurement is usually centre-weighted (predominantly based on the image centre).
Some cameras (and meters) permit spot readings covering a small subject area only and give reliable exposures if this selected area is a medium subject tone.
The selection of an appropriate aperture and shutter speed among equivalent camera exposures depends on depth-of-field and subject-movement requirements.
Some automatic cameras simplify this by selecting just one such combination at each exposure level (program automation).
FLASH EXPOSURES
Most current electronic flash units incorporate a sensor cell that measures the light reflected from the subject and controls the flash duration (and hence the exposure) accordingly.
In certain cameras in which photocells measure the light reflected from the film, the same cells can similarly control the flash duration of suitable dedicated flash units.
Lacking these provisions, flash exposures may be determined by measurement or by guide-number calculation.
Special meters can measure flash light quantity on a scene during a test firing of flashes; these are used extensively with more elaborate studio setups.
Flash exposure calculations rely on the fact that the exposure depends only on the lens aperture. (
The electronic flash is usually much shorter than the synchronizable shutter time.)
The light intensity reaching the film is inversely proportional to the square of the diaphragm f-number.
By basic illumination laws the light intensity on a scene is also inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the light source and subject.
For a given flash source and film speed, the exposure is thus constant for a constant product of distance and f-number.
Flash manufacturers quote this product as a guide number for various flash–film combinations.
For rapid exposure calculation, dividing the guide number by the flash-to-subject distance gives the required f-number; dividing the guide number by the f-number gives the distance at which the flash must be arranged for correct exposure.
Some cameras use this principle for semiautomatic flash-exposure control: the aperture adjustment is coupled with the distance setting on the lens (or with an automatic rangefinding system) so that the lens aperture gets larger with increasing distance.
This coupling is adjustable for different flash guide numbers.
EXPOSURE LATITUDE
The ideal negative exposure records the darkest subject shadows as a just visible density.
More exposure yields a denser negative, which, however, can still give an acceptable print by appropriate print-exposure adjustment.
This range of usable negative exposures, the exposure latitude, depends on the film and the subject.
This latitude is greater the lower the subject contrast and the greater the film’s exposure range (and, generally, the lower the film contrast).
Because of exposure latitude, simple cameras with limited exposure adjustability can still yield acceptable pictures under differing light conditions.
<Caption> An underexposed negative (top) has few details in the shadow areas.
An overexposed negative (middle) is dark and lacks detail in bright areas.
A normally exposed negative (bottom) shows details in both light and dark areas.
YOUSUF KARSH
Yousuf Karsh, also known as Karsh of Ottawa (1908–2002), was a Turkish-born Canadian photographer known for his portraits of important personages.
As an Armenian in Turkey, the young Karsh endured persecution and privation.
In 1924, at age 16, he immigrated to Canada, joining his uncle, who was a photographer, in Sherbrooke, Quebec.
From 1928 to 1931 he served as an apprentice to a Boston painter and portrait photographer and briefly attended art school.
Returning to Canada in 1932, he was employed by an Ottawa photographer, whose studio Karsh leased after his employer retired.
He was appointed official portrait photographer of the Canadian government in 1935 and became a naturalized Canadian citizen in 1947.
Karsh’s often-reproduced portrait of Sir Winston Churchill, made in Ottawa in 1941, brilliantly conveys the dogged determination of Britain’s wartime leader and brought Karsh his first major international fame.
He went on to photograph many of the world’s most prominent personalities, including royalty, statesmen, artists, and writers.
Karsh used dramatic lighting to meticulously model his subjects’ faces, thereby obtaining a monumental and idealized presentation that helped promote their public image.
Most of his portraits were taken in black and white.
Books of his photographs include Faces of Destiny (1946), Portraits of Greatness (1959), In Search of Greatness (1962), Faces of Our Time (1971), Karsh Canadians (1978), and Karsh: A Sixty-Year Retrospective (1996), among others.
LIGHTING TECHNIQUE
The kind of lighting on the scene governs the way in which the picture reproduces the subject.
Orientation of the subject - as in taking a portrait - with respect to the light direction can often control the effect.
Lighting from behind the camera (front lighting) gives flat effects, light from one side yields depth and modeling, while the principal light from behind the subject produces dramatic against-the-light effects of high contrast.
Artificial light setups in the studio, with tungsten lamps or electronic flash, offer the greatest flexibility.
Under such conditions the photographer can arrange two or more lamps for various lighting effects.
Directional lighting improves detail contrast and brilliance.
Excessive subject contrast, however, makes accurate exposure settings difficult and may lead to loss of picture detail in the highlights or shadows.
Fill-in lighting, by a flash or other light source on or near the camera, can illuminate heavy shadows facing the camera.
<Caption> Front lighting with the light placed slightly to the right of the camera (top, left) causes even and fairly flat illumination.
Backlighting (top, right) can create a silhouette effect.
Side lighting (bottom, left) casts illumination on half of the subject, modeling him in three-dimensional form.
Bottom lighting (bottom, right) is used to give the subject a haunting aura.
Photographers have a wide variety of light sources at their disposal.
The sun itself remains the most richly varied and versatile source of outdoor lighting.
They can work with the blazing light of the noonday sun, the silvery illumination of a foggy day, the soft lighting of an overcast sky, or the dramatic hues and shadows of a sunset.
Using fast film, photographers can take pictures indoors - by normal indoor lighting or by sunlight entering through a door or window - or outdoors at night by the artificial glow of street lights.
Sometimes, however, an adjustable or portable artificial light source is required.
One such source is the photoflood, which is powered by ordinary house current and provides a continuous source of illumination over its lifetime.
At one time flashbulbs were widely used.
These disposable bulbs produce a bright momentary flash of light that is synchronized with the opening of the camera’s shutter.
Today they have been largely supplanted by the electronic flash.
Electronic flash units are available in a range of sizes from miniature versions built into small cameras to large, powerful studio units.
These too must be synchronized with the camera’s shutter, but they provide many thousands of flashes without the need of replacement.
Specialized units having a very brief flash duration are used to stop fast action.
CHAPTER FOUR
BLACK-AND-WHITE PROCESSING AND PRINTING
From minilabs to huge laboratories, a variety of processing services are available to both amateur and professional photographers.
Many photographers, however, prefer to develop their film and also make prints and enlargements themselves.
They find it a satisfying activity that provides many possibilities for creativity and self-expression.
NEGATIVE DEVELOPMENT
Amateurs usually process films in developing tanks.
In this type of development roll or miniature film is wound around a reel with a spiral groove, which keeps adjacent turns separated and allows access by the processing solutions.
Once the tank is loaded (in the dark), processing takes place in normal light, the processing baths (developer, intermediate rinse, fixer) being poured into the tank at the appropriate intervals.
Sheet films are similarly treated in small tanks or held in hangers and immersed sequentially in the different processing solutions.
Large-scale commercial processing laboratories use machines that automatically feed the films through the solutions in proper sequence.
<Caption> A photographer removes a printed photo from the stop bath in his darkroom.
Common darkroom equipment includes trays for the developer, stop bath, fixer, and rinse.
An enlarger (at left) creates enlarged images from negatives.
DEVELOPERS AND THEIR CHARACTERISTICS
The developer consists typically of one or more developing agents, a preservative (such as sodium sulfite) to prevent oxidation by the air, an alkali (such as sodium carbonate) to activate the developer, and a restrainer or antifoggant to ensure that the developer acts only on exposed silver halide crystals.
A developer’s main characteristics are activity, development speed, and effect on film gradation, graininess, and sharpness.
Developers may be prepared on the basis of published formulas or bought as ready-mixed powders or concentrates for dilution with water.
DARKROOM EQUIPMENT
Although many amateur photographers prefer a photographic darkroom, it is not necessary for processing black-and-white film.
With the so-called time-and-temperature method, a daylight tank can be used.
The tank must be loaded with film in total darkness, but once the tank top is in place the remainder of the processing can be completed in ordinary room light.
The processing is monitored with the aid of a clock or timer and a thermometer.
Daylight developing tanks are made of plastic or stainless steel and consist of three parts: the cylindrical tank itself, a reel upon which the film is rolled, and a lightproof cover through which solutions can be poured.
Other equipment includes a number of graduated flasks for mixing and pouring, a stirring rod, funnel, dip-type darkroom thermometer, timer, fine-textured cellulose photographic sponges for wiping the film, and metal clips for hanging the film to dry.
Packaged processing chemicals are available either in the form of powder or as liquid concentrates called stock solutions.
Either kind must be mixed with water to make a working solution.
For complete film processing it is necessary to have working solutions of developer, short-stop, and fixer.
The developer is allowed to act for a specific time to build up the image to the required density and contrast.
This time depends on the developer, the temperature, the degree of agitation, and the film - as indicated by recommendations from film and developer manufacturers.
FIXING
The fixing bath contains a chemical (sodium or ammonium thiosulfate) that converts the silver halide into soluble, complex silver salts that dissolve in the fixer.
During this process the film loses its original silver halide milkiness overlaying the image and becomes clear.
The fixer also contains a weak acid (to halt the development process) and a hardening agent to reduce gelatin swelling.
WASHING AND DRYING
Washing removes all residual soluble chemicals from the emulsion and must be thorough for image permanence.
Films are hung up to dry after removal from the tank.
HIGH-SPEED PROCESSING
Greatly reduced processing times are possible with high-activity developers at elevated temperatures and with fast-acting fixing agents, such as ammonium thiosulfate.
Such processes can cut access time to the negative down to less than a minute.
One-bath (monobath) processing in a solution containing both a fast-acting developing agent and fixing chemicals also reduces processing time.
In special rapid-access processing equipment, films pass through chambers spraying the processing solutions onto the film surface or run in contact with monobath-soaked webs.
PRINTING
The simplest printing equipment is the contact printing frame in which the negative and printing paper are held together behind a glass plate during exposure to a suitable lamp.
A printing box is essentially a printing frame with a built-in light source.
Contact printing gives a positive of the same size as the negative.
ENLARGERS
Negatives usually are enlarged to prints of the desired final size.
The enlarger, also called a projection printer, is a device for producing a photographic print or negative larger than the original negative or transparency.
The modern enlarger consists of a projection assembly attached to a vertical column that is mounted on a horizontal base.
The projection assembly includes an enclosed illumination system, a holder for positioning and flattening the film, a lens for projecting the image onto the base (which holds the photosensitive printing paper), and a mechanism for focusing the image onto the paper.
The entire assembly can be raised or lowered in a track on the column to adjust the size of the print, and many of the operating components can be controlled automatically.
The illumination system is made up of the light source, usually an incandescent lightbulb but sometimes another type of bulb such as fluorescent or halogen, plus an optical system for directing the light efficiently to the film.
One type of optical system is the condenser, a system of lenses that focus the beam of light through the film and toward the enlarging lens.
Another type is the diffuser, which scatters the light from the bulb so that it falls evenly across the film.
Light sources and optical systems are chosen depending on the type of film being used and the characteristics desired on the enlarged print.
Condensers are used for prints with fine detail and high contrast, whereas diffusers are used to minimize blemishes.
A filter drawer between the light source and the film permits the insertion of colour filters or variable contrast filters.
Traditional film-based photographic enlarging has declined considerably with the switch to digital photography, its place being taken by printers such as the ink-jet.
However, there is still a use for film-based enlargers in some commercial and art photography where the qualities of photosensitive paper are desired.
In addition, some digital enlargers can work from a digital image file instead of a film negative.
Some read the file and then re-create the image on a liquid-crystal display (LCD) panel that is inserted into the projection assembly in the place of the film negative.
In others, a laser spot can scan directly across a photosensitive material without using an LCD.
PRINTING PAPERS
Papers for enlarging and contact printing are produced in grades of differing exposure range - i.e.,
ratios of shortest to longest exposure to produce the lightest tone and a full black, respectively.
The various grades yield prints of a normal tone range from negatives of different contrasts: a soft paper grade for a high-contrast negative, a normal paper for a normal negative, a hard paper for soft negatives, and so on.
Paper grades are also numbered - typically from 0 to 5 - in ascending order of contrast.
Variable-contrast papers use a mixture of two emulsions of a different contrast and colour sensitivity; the contribution of each is controlled by filters in the path of the exposing light.
Other characteristics of printing papers are the speed (slower for contact papers, faster for enlarging papers), image colour (blue-black to warm brown), surface texture (glossy, velvet, mat), and base thickness (single or double weight).
Most printing materials use a resin-coated (plastic-laminated) paper base that absorbs no water during processing.
PRINTING EXPOSURES
Correct printing exposures are determined by trial and error or by test strips given a series of progressively increasing exposures.
More sophisticated exposure control systems measure either the brightness of selected image portions projected on the enlarger baseboard or the average light intensity reaching the paper during the exposure.
Printing papers are exposed and processed in a darkroom lit by an olive-green or orange safelight.
Printing papers are sensitive to violet, blue, and sometimes green light.
PRINT PROCESSING
The processing of prints consists of development, an intermediate rinse or stop bath, fixing, and washing.
The developer and fixer are similar in principle to those used for negative films.
In the normal method, dish or tray processing, prints are immersed successively in the solutions in dishes laid out side by side.
Development is checked visually, the print remaining in the developer until the image has reached its full density.
After development is complete, the film is rinsed in a stop bath.
This bath halts the chemical action of the developer and prevents contamination of the following solution.
Packaged stop baths are available, but many photographers prepare their own using a mixture of acetic acid and water.
The next step in processing is to place the film in a fixing bath.
This dissolves any undeveloped particles of silver halide and leaves only the developed grains of black, metallic silver.
A commonly used fixer is a solution of hypo mixed with water.
Depending on the hypo’s freshness, such a fixing bath may take ten minutes or longer to be fully effective.
There are a number of rapid or high-speed fixers available, however, that require only a couple of minutes or less.
After fixing, the film is thoroughly washed to remove any residual chemicals and to ensure the permanence of the negative.
For drying, the prints may be clipped to a line, placed in a heated print dryer, or squeegeed onto a mirror-finished plate for a high-gloss surface.
STABILIZATION PROCESSING
Certain rapid-processing papers incorporate developing agents in their emulsions and are processed on a roller processor.
This processor runs the paper through an activating bath for instant development and then through a stabilizing bath, followed by a pair of squeegeeing rollers from which the print emerges merely damp.
This process takes about 10 to 15 seconds; the prints, however, do not keep quite as well as conventional prints, since unexposed silver salts are not removed from the emulsion but only converted into moderately light-stable compounds.
Such prints can be made more permanent by subsequent fixing and washing.
DRY PROCESSING
Processing baths can be completely eliminated by incorporating in the emulsion of the paper development and stabilization chemicals that become active on heating.
One method is to disperse the processing chemicals in the emulsion in microscopic capsules containing the solution and a blowing agent.
On passing the exposed paper over a heated roller, the blowing agent bursts the capsules, and the liberated processing solutions act on the silver halide immediately around each capsule.
The liquid solvent instantly evaporates, leaving a dry print.
Encapsulation materials are used for such purposes as making proof prints of negatives and reenlarging microfilm images.
Certain non-silver processes in photocopying systems also offer dry processing.
CHAPTER FIVE
COLOUR PHOTOGRAPHY
Present-day colour photographic processes are tricolour systems, reproducing different colours that occur in nature by suitable combinations of three primary-coloured stimuli.
Each of these primary colours - blue-violet, green, and red - covers roughly one-third of the visible spectrum.
Tricolour impressions can be produced by combining coloured lights (additive synthesis) or by passing white light through combinations of complementary filters, each of which holds back one of the primary colours (subtractive synthesis).
<Caption> Light’s primary colours - green (1), blue (2), and red (3) - are shown here.
Mixing two primary colours of light can make cyan (4), yellow (5), and magenta (6).
Mixing all three makes white (7).
In additive synthesis a combination of red and blue-violet light (e.g., light beams of the two colours directed on the same spot of a white screen) gives a purplish pink (magenta); equal parts of red and green produce yellow, and equal parts of green and blue-violet produce bluish green (cyan).
Superimposition of all three light beams on a screen yields white; combinations of varying proportions of two or three of the colours produce virtually all the other hues.
In subtractive synthesis yellow, magenta, and cyan filters or dye layers subtract varying proportions of the primary colours from white light.
The yellow filter absorbs the blue component of white light and so controls the amount of blue present in a white-light beam that has passed through the filter.
Similarly, the magenta filter controls the amount of green light left, and the cyan controls the amount of the red component.
A cyan and a magenta filter superimposed in a white-light beam hold back both the red and the green component, making the emerging beam blue.
Similarly, a cyan and a yellow filter together yield green, and a yellow and a magenta filter together yield red.
Superimposing such filters or dye images of different densities in a white-light beam can therefore re-create any colour impression in the same way as superimposing light beams of the primary colours.
<Caption> Yellow (1), cyan (2), and magenta (3) are the primary colours of pigments, or inks.
A mixture of two primary colours of pigments can make green (4), red (5), or blue (6).
A mixture of all three makes black (7).
The difference between additive and subtractive synthesis is the approach: in additive synthesis colours are built up by combining different intensities of primary-coloured light, and in subtractive synthesis colours are achieved by removing different proportions of primary-coloured light from white light.
Most modern colour films are based on subtractive synthesis.
Either method of colour synthesis should be capable of reproducing every existing colour in nature.
In practice, the reproduction is imperfect; no filter dyes meet the required ideal specifications.
Nevertheless, for most purposes reproduction is adequate.
COLOUR FILMS
There are two basic types of color film in general use: color reversal and color negative.
When processed, a color reversal film produces a positive transparency in which the colors match those of the original subject.
It can be viewed by the transmitted light of a hand viewer or light box, or it can be mounted as a color slide for projection.
A color negative film, on the other hand, produces a color negative in which the colors are complementary to those of the subject.
This negative is used to make color prints and enlargements for viewing with reflected light.
So-called “white” light can vary considerably from bluish to yellowish.
The human eye adapts to these variations easily, and so most persons are unaware of differences in lighting.
Color film, however, cannot adjust to such differences.
It is balanced, or matched, to provide the most natural-looking colors with the use of one particular light source.
For example, a daylight-type color film is designed to be used with daylight, which is bluish, or with an electronic flash, which creates a bluish light.
Another film, Type A film, is balanced for the much more yellowish illumination given by a photoflood bulb.
Tungsten, or Type B, film is matched to the light of tungsten-halogen bulbs.
For the most natural-looking results, photographers use color film with the light source for which it is balanced, or they use the proper conversion filter.
Instant, or self-processing, film is available for taking both color and black-and-white photographs.
In this type of film, the chemicals necessary to develop the latent image on the emulsion and produce a finished print are included in the film itself.
The chemicals are automatically activated when the film is removed from the camera.
Development may take place very rapidly - within a matter of seconds - depending on the particular make of film and the ambient temperature.
REVERSAL (SLIDE) FILMS
To reproduce colour by subtractive three-colour synthesis, colour films first break down the colours of an image into their primary components by means of three separate sensitized layers, each of which responds exclusively to blue, green, or red light.
The image in each layer is reversal-processed to yield a positive dye image in a colour complementary to the layer’s spectral sensitivity.
Thus, the blue-sensitive layer first yields a negative image of everything blue in the original scene (e.g., the blue sky) and then a positive image of everything that is not blue.
This positive image is coloured yellow.
Similarly, the green-recording layer yields a magenta positive image of everything that is not green, and the red-recording layer a positive cyan image of everything that is not red.
Blue sky, for instance, does not figure in the yellow positive image but does figure in the magenta positive image (not being green) and in the cyan positive image (not being red).
The magenta and cyan dyes in the areas that were blue sky are superimposed, and white light passing through the resulting transparency loses its green and red, but not its blue, component; thus, the sky appears blue.
Similarly, green subject components end up as positive yellow image density in the blue-recording and positive cyan density in the red-recording layer, combining to green in the transparency.
Yellow records as a negative image in the green-recording and red-recording layers, hence leaving a positive yellow image only in the blue-recording layer.
All other colours are formed by similar combinations of different densities of the dye images.
NEGATIVE (PRINT) FILMS
Negative colour materials work in a similar way but yield a negative dye image by direct development.
Blue subject tones record in the blue-sensitive film layer to produce a yellow negative image.
Green colour components yield a magenta dye image in the green-responding layer, and red components yield a cyan dye image in the red-recording layer.
With respect to the subject, the colour negative therefore reverses the tones in brightness as well as in colour.
Printing the colour negative on a colour paper with three differentially responding layers reverses the process once more, reconstituting the original subject colours in a positive print.
COLOUR-FILM STRUCTURE
Reversal colour film has these components: (1) A top layer of plain gelatin, which protects the underlying layers against abrasion and damage. (
2) The first emulsion layer, which contains blue-sensitive silver halide plus a yellow-forming colour coupler.
This is a colourless substance that reacts with the decomposition products of the developing agent to generate dye in all areas where a silver image is produced and in proportion to the density of that silver image. (
3) A yellow filter layer, which holds back blue light from the subsequent emulsion layers.
It disappears during the bleaching stage of processing. (
4) The second emulsion layer, which contains blueand green-sensitive silver halide plus a magenta-forming colour coupler.
The blue sensitivity is suppressed by the yellow filter layer. (
5) The next emulsion, which is blue-and-red sensitive (blue again being suppressed) and contains a cyan-forming colour coupler. (
6) A substrate, which ensures optimum adhesion of the emulsion layers to the film base and may also contain light-absorbing silver to prevent the scattering of light by reflection from the support surface (halation). (
7) The film base, or support, of clear cellulose acetate derivative (or sometimes polyester), typically about 0.005 inch thick. (
8) The back of the support, which carries a light-absorbing layer (an alternative to the antihalation layer in the substrate); on roll film this also acts as an anticurl layer.
This scheme can vary.
Often one or more of the selectively sensitized layers is duplicated.
Some reversal colour films do not incorporate colour couplers in the emulsions but introduce them in the processing solutions.
Processing such nonsubstantive colour films is more complex than processing substantive-coupler films containing couplers in the emulsions.
Negative colour films are similar, but the couplers are often already coloured yellow or red or both.
The unreacted couplers remain as positive images, which compensate for some deviations of the image dyes from the colour characteristics of ideal dyes.
Such negatives have an apparently overall reddish or orange tint.
Some colour films come with different combinations of colour sensitivity and dye colour formed in the individual layers for deliberately falsified colour rendering (false-colour films) in special applications.
Colour-positive (print) materials have a paper or white, opaque film base instead of transparent film and have no antihalation layer.
The emulsion sequence may be different from the above scheme; their spectral sensitivities may be keyed to the transmission characteristics of the negative dyes for better colour reproduction.
The dye images are reasonably lightfast but fade on prolonged exposure to ultraviolet-rich radiation.
Colour transparencies and prints intended for continuous display may be protected by ultraviolet-absorbing coatings or filter layers.
ADDITIVE COLOUR FILMS
These are simpler in structure and consist, in addition to protective and other interlayers, of a film base, carrying a filter raster, and a black-and-white emulsion layer.
The raster consists of sequences of very narrow red, green, and blue transparent filter lines (up to 1,800 lines per inch) through which the light from the lens passes before it reaches the emulsion layer.
The emulsion layer is processed to a positive image.
Red subject portions cause silver to be deposited behind non-red (i.e., green and blue) filter elements, leaving the red filter lines transparent.
Similarly, green subject details leave green filter lines transparent but block red and blue.
Other colours affect areas behind two or even three filter lines - for example, yellow leaves red and green filter lines clear.
In such areas the eye cannot resolve the separate filter elements but gets an additive impression of yellow.
Other colours form corresponding additive effects, including white, where all three filter elements are transparent.
Because of the presence of the filter elements everywhere in the image, additive colour transparencies are much denser than subtractive ones; at high magnification the filter raster pattern may also become visible.
Additive colour transparencies are used only in rapid-access diffusion-transfer systems.
COLOUR BALANCE
Colour film reacts to all hue and tone differences, including the prevailing light colour.
A film recording approximately natural colours in daylight reproduces scenes photographed by tungsten light with a reddish overall tint - because this lighting is richer in red rays than is daylight.
This spectral balance of different “white” light sources may be rated numerically by the colour temperature - a concept of theoretical physics that, with tungsten lighting, corresponds roughly to the absolute lamp-filament temperature.
Such absolute temperatures are expressed in kelvins (K).
The higher the colour temperature the richer the light is in bluish and the poorer it is in reddish rays and vice versa.
Average daylight is rated at about 5,500 K, the light from an overcast sky from 6,500 K up; the colour temperature of tungsten lamps ranges between 2,600 and 3,400 K.
To ensure correct “white-light” colour reproduction with different types of lighting, the sensitivities of the three film layers must be matched to the colour temperature of the light.
Colour slide (reversal) films are therefore made in different versions balanced for faithful rendering either with 5,500 to 6,000 K light sources (such as daylight or electronic flash) or with specified tungsten lighting (3,200 to 3,400 K).
Such accurate film balance matching is less vital with negative colour films since the colour rendering of the print can be modified during colour printing. “
Universal” amateur negative colour films are usable with any light, from tungsten to daylight.
For high quality, professional negative colour films are still preferentially balanced to either daylight or tungsten sources.
Strongly coloured filters are suitable only for special effects; they overlay the colour image with the filter colour.
Pale correction filters can match a film to a light source other than that for which it is balanced - e.g.,
pale blue, with a daylight-type film used in tungsten lighting, to raise in effect the colour temperature.
Pale pink or amber filters similarly reduce the colour temperature for using artificial-light-balanced films in daylight.
Colour-film manufacturers publish detailed recommendations of actual filters required for such conversion.
In outdoor photography, especially involving distant views, an ultraviolet-absorbing filter is often required, as ultraviolet radiation records in the blue-sensitive layer of the film, producing an overall blue cast in the transparency.
A pale pink skylight filter for outdoor subjects lit only by skylight counteracts the cold, bluish colour rendering resulting from such illumination.
<Caption> A photographer puts a UV lens filter on a Nikon D3S digital camera.
A UV-absorbing filter is frequently used for outdoor photography to counteract certain lighting effects.
COLOUR-FILM PROCESSING
The processing sequence for colour materials is longer than for black-and-white films and requires more solutions.
Development needs very precise timing and temperature control.
Colour films can be processed in amateur developing tanks; professionals use sets of tanks in temperature-controlled water jackets with provision for standardized solution agitation.
STEVE McCURRY
Steve McCurry (born 1950) is an American photojournalist whose vibrant and colorful photos typically focus on people from around the world who have been affected by wars and conflicts.
His well-composed subjects and broad use of colour have resulted in some of the most iconic and well-known photographs in modern times.
During one of his first assignments in 1979 he secretly crossed into Afghanistan where he captured photos of people affected by the Soviet invasion.
Rolls of film sewn into his clothes were smuggled in and out of the country and published by Time magazine.
His pictures from the assignment won him the Robert Capa Gold Medal in 1980.
His often colorful images of people around the world eventually led to his most famous photo, “Afghan Girl,” which appeared on the cover of National Geographic in 1985.
Steve McCurry poses next to his acclaimed photograph “Afghan Girl” at an exhibition of his work in Germany in 2013.
The iconic photo depicts a beautiful green-eyed girl from a refugee camp along the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Curry’s use of colour makes the image memorable and timeless.
The main colors in the photograph - green and red - are also complimentary to one another on the color wheel.
The girl’s striking green eyes become the focus of the image, which has already been hailed as a modern classic.
REVERSAL COLOUR-FILM PROCESSING
Most colour films use a standard processing sequence and chemistry (usually available in kits).
For substantive films (incorporating couplers in the emulsion) the sequence comprises: (1) development to form a negative silver image in each emulsion layer; (2) a reversal bath that renders developable the remaining silver halide in each emulsion layer; (3) colour development to produce a positive silver image in the remaining silver halide plus a coincident dye image by reaction with the colour couplers; (4) bleaching and fixing to reconvert the negative and positive silver images into silver halide and to dissolve the latter out of the emulsion, leaving only the three dye images; (5) a final rinse and stabilizer to remove soluble chemicals and improve light-fastness of the dyes; and (6) drying.
There are also intermediate rinse stages.
The complete sequence without drying takes a little longer than 30 minutes.
Processing of nonsubstantive colour films, in which the couplers are in the colour developer, is more complex because each emulsion layer is reexposed by appropriately coloured light and colour-developed separately.
This operation requires automated processing machinery.
NEGATIVE COLOUR PROCESSING
Negative colour films are practically all of the substantive-coupler type.
Most again follow a standard processing sequence consisting of colour development (forming a negative silver image in each emulsion layer together with a corresponding dye image), a rinse, and a bleaching and fixing stage to convert the silver image into silver halide and dissolve that (plus residual halide) out of the emulsion.
A final rinse and drying conclude the process, which, excluding drying, takes about 12 minutes.
Substantially the same procedure is followed for processing positive colour papers.
COLOUR PRINTING
Colour print processing may be done in dishes or trays or in light-tight drums that are rotated manually or mechanically, processing solutions being poured in and out in succession.
Professional colour laboratories use more elaborate versions of such rotating drum systems or roller or other automated machines that transport prints through the different solutions in turn.
POSITIVE PRINTS FROM COLOUR NEGATIVES
Positive prints may be obtained from colour negatives by enlarging the colour negative onto a positive colour paper.
Colour control consists of modifying the colour of the printing light by yellow, magenta, and cyan filters (typically by inserting high-density filters of these colours to varying degrees in the light path) to obtain a print of the correct or desired colour balance.
The light is thoroughly mixed in a diffusing box before reaching the negative.
An alternative method is to have three light sources behind the yellow, magenta, and cyan filters and to adjust their relative intensities or switch them on for different exposure times.
This subtractive, or white-light, printing method depends on subtracting or holding back colour components of white light.
Commercial photofinishing printers often use an additive system in which prints are given successive exposures through high-density red, green, and blue filters.
Each of these exposures forms the image in one of the emulsion layers of the paper; colour balance depends on the proportions of the individual exposures.
In automatic colour printing systems the exposures are controlled by photocells that evaluate the red, green, and blue components of light transmitted by the negative.
REVERSAL COLOUR PRINTING
Colour transparencies can be printed on a reversal colour paper similar to a reversal film and processed in an analogous way.
The same kind of colour control with filters is again possible, but the colour effect of the subtractive filters or of the additive filter exposures is reversed.
DYE-DESTRUCTION PROCESSES
Dye-destruction processes differ from chromogenic colour materials (where colour images are produced during development) in starting off with emulsion layers containing the final dyes.
During processing these are bleached in proportion to the silver image formed.
Straightforward processing of a dye-destruction or dye-bleach material yields a positive image from a positive original and consists of: (1) development to form a silver image; (2) stop-fixing to arrest development and remove unexposed silver halide; (3) dye bleaching to bleach the dye in the areas containing a silver image; (4) silver bleaching to convert the silver image into silver halide; and (5) fixing to remove residual silver halide.
Washing is done between all the processing stages.
Obtaining a positive image from a negative requires a more elaborate processing sequence, analogous to reversal processing in a chromogenic system.
Dye-bleach materials use far more light-stable dyes than those produced by colour-coupling development.
The positive–positive procedure also yields duplicate transparencies on dye-bleach materials with a transparent film base.
DIFFUSION-TRANSFER COLOUR PRINTS
Materials derived from instant-picture diffusion-transfer processes have been adapted to colour print production.
They are more expensive than traditional colour print materials but considerably easier to process.
In their simplest form they require only a single highly alkaline activator bath followed by a water rinse, the whole sequence lasting about five to 10 minutes, with considerable processing latitude.
Such materials exist for prints from either negatives or transparencies.
The colour printing and filter control principles are the same as with the traditional processes described above.
ASSEMBLY COLOUR PRINTS
The original method of producing colour prints was based on separation negatives obtained by photographing the original scene on separate black-and-white plates or films through a blue, green, and red filter, respectively.
This method analyzes the subject in terms of its tricolour components in the same way as the initial negative images in a three-layer colour film.
Positive prints from the separation negatives, converted into colour images (e.g., by toning) and superimposed on top of each other, yield a subtractive tricolour print.
The main surviving assembly print process, dye transfer, uses a set of separation positives on a panchromatic matrix film made either from separation negatives of a colour transparency or by separation (three filtered exposures) from a colour negative.
Appropriate processing converts the matrix film into a gelatin relief image whose depth is proportional to the positive silver density.
Each matrix is soaked in a dye solution (yellow for the matrix derived from the blue-filter negative and so on), and the dyes from the matrices are transferred in succession to a single sheet of gelatin-coated paper.
Elaborate care is required to ensure accurate superimposition (registration) of the dye images; the result is a positive colour print.
Up to 150 prints can be obtained from a set of gelatin-relief positives simply by redyeing them and repeating the transfer.
In the late 20th century, the development of a panchromatic matrix film made it possible to produce the relief positives directly from a colour negative.
TRANSPARENCY PROJECTION
Many amateur colour pictures are in the form of transparencies, particularly on 35-mm film.
These are usually mounted in plastic or card frames or bound between glass for projection on a screen in a darkened room.
The projector consists of a lens, a holder for the slide, and a lighting system (lamp, reflector, and condenser lenses to concentrate the light onto the slide).
Modern slide projectors take the slides in magazines or trays holding 30 to 50 or more slides.
An automatic slide transport feeds each slide from the tray into the light path of the projector and may be operated from a remote control unit or by pulses from a tape recorder, which can also record a commentary to the complete slide series.
Some projectors feature remote-controlled or automatic focusing to keep each successive slide image sharp on the screen.
The standard miniature slide size is 2 × 2 inches for transparencies up to 1 5/8 × 1 5/8 inches; the most usual transparency format in such slides is 24 × 36 millimetres.
Projectors for larger slides (e.g., 2 3/4 × 2 3/4 inches for transparencies up to 2 1/4 × 2 1/4 inches) and ultraminiature projectors (e.g., 10 × 14-millimetre transparencies in 3 × 3-centimetre slide frames) are suitably scaled-up or scaled-down versions of the standard models.
The size of the projected image depends on the distance of the projector from the screen and the focal length of the projection lens.
Projectors may also project from the back onto a translucent screen; such rear-projection setups are more compact, and the image is often bright enough for viewing in daylight.
The rear-projection system is used in schools and for commercial displays.
Elaborate slide shows are produced by linking two or more projectors aimed at the same or adjacent screen areas.
With a suitably assembled slide set, the pictures can be made to change, overlap, and assemble, according to a predetermined program.
CHAPTER SIX
INSTANT-PICTURE PHOTOGRAPHY
Cameras with built-in processing facilities, to reduce the delay between exposure and the availability of the processed picture, were proposed from the 1850s onward.
The ferrotype process later adapted for “while-you-wait” photography by itinerant street and beach photographers goes back almost as far.
Because of the messiness of handling liquid chemicals in or just outside the camera, such systems remained largely impractical.
In the 1940s Edwin H. Land, a U.S. scientist and inventor, designed a film configuration that included a sealed pod containing processing chemicals in a viscous jelly or paste form to permit virtually dry processing inside the camera and yield a positive print within a minute or less of exposure.
Land demonstrated (1947), and through his Polaroid Corporation marketed (1948), a camera and materials that realized this system.
It used a positive sheet and negative emulsion, the latter being discarded after use.
An instant-print colour film (Polacolor) was introduced in 1963 and an integral single-sheet colour film in 1972.
After the mid-1970s other manufacturers offered similar instant-print processes.
In 1977 Polaroid introduced an 8-mm colour movie film, and in 1982 it introduced still transparency films that permit rapid processing outside the camera.
<Caption> This person is removing an instantly developed photograph from a Polaroid camera in 1948.
BLACK-AND-WHITE DIFFUSION TRANSFER
The Polaroid process is based on negative paper carrying a silver halide emulsion and a nonsensitized, positive sheet containing development nuclei.
After the exposure the two sheets are brought into intimate contact by being pulled between a pair of pressure rollers.
These rupture a sealed pod (attached to the positive sheet) to spread processing chemicals - in the form of a viscous jelly - between the two sheets.
This reagent develops a negative image and causes the silver salts from the unexposed areas to diffuse into the positive layer and deposit metallic silver on the development nuclei.
After about 30 seconds to one minute the negative and positive sheets are peeled apart and the negative can be discarded.
In special versions of the process the negative may be washed and treated to give a conventional negative for normal enlarging.
POLAROID CORPORATION
The Polaroid Corporation, also called Primary PDC, Inc., is an American manufacturer of cameras, film, and optical equipment founded by Edwin Herbert Land (1909–91), who invented instant photography.
The company originated in 1932 as the Land-Wheelwright Laboratories, which Land founded with George Wheelwright to produce Land’s first invention, an inexpensive plastic-sheet light polarizer.
By 1936 Land began to use polarized material in sunglasses and other optical devices, and in 1937 the company was incorporated under the Polaroid name.
During the 1930s and ’40s Polaroid introduced a three-dimensional motion-picture process and polarized optical devices for military use.
After World War II, Land began to research an instantaneous developing film, and in 1947 the company brought out the Polaroid Land camera, which delivered a finished sepia-toned print 60 seconds after exposure.
In the 1950s the cameras were refined to produce black-and-white prints in 15 seconds; in the 1960s a colour-developing process and film cartridges were introduced.
The company introduced the compact Polaroid SX-70 in 1972.
In addition to further technical refinements, the SX-70 combined both negative and positive prints in a single sheet.
Instant motion pictures were introduced in 1977.
After Land retired as chief executive officer in 1980, Polaroid continued to develop new products for professional, technical, and consumer markets.
These included cameras, high-speed film, floppy disks, medical equipment, colour-transparency films, transparent cameras, and identity verification equipment for security systems.
In 1986 Polaroid won a $925-million judgment from the Eastman Kodak Company for patent infringement.
In the 1990s Polaroid delivered more firsts to the industry, including cameras with picture-storage compartments, and introduced several products that were worldwide best sellers, such as the redesigned Polaroid OneStep camera.
In 1996 the corporation released its first digital camera.
In 2001 Polaroid filed for bankruptcy protection, the result of what many believed was the failure of the company to fully embrace digital technology.
In less than a year, most of the corporation’s assets and those of its subsidiaries had been sold to OEP Imaging Corporation, creating a new company, Primary PDC, Inc., which continued to operate as Polaroid Corporation; OEP Imaging Corporation subsequently became Polaroid Holding Company (PHC).
In 2005 PHC was purchased by Petters Group Worldwide.
Polaroid remained under bankruptcy protection until 2006.
Although it had no employees or business operations during that time, the brand name continued to be used to license and market various foreign-made electronics.
By 2007, however, the company had stopped making cameras altogether.
In 2008 Polaroid announced that it would permanently cease production of instant film by early 2009.
Later in 2008, Polaroid’s parent company, Petters Group, filed for bankruptcy protection, though Polaroid continued to manufacture and market new products.
In the original Polaroid instant-picture process the material was a dual roll of negative and positive sheets.
Later versions of this peel-apart process use film packs and sheet films.
They require special cameras incorporating the pressure rollers that operate the spread of processing jelly while the peel-apart sandwich is fed out of the camera.
Special camera backs with this mechanism allow the use of Polaroid materials in professional cameras taking interchangeable film holders or magazines.
Peel-apart Polaroid systems include high-speed emulsions, high-contrast, process, transparency, and scientific materials.
Silver diffusion-transfer processes were invented in 1939 in Belgium and Germany and were used for a number of years in office copying systems until superseded by dry copying processes.
THE POLACOLOR PROCESS
Polaroid colour film has a larger number of active layers, including a blue-sensitive silver halide emulsion backed by a layer consisting of a yellow dye–developer compound, a green-sensitive layer backed by a layer of magenta dye–developer, and a red-sensitive layer backed by a cyan dye–developer.
The dye–developer in each case consists of dye molecules (not colour couplers) chemically linked to developing agent molecules.
After exposure and activation by the alkaline jelly, the dye–developer molecules in each layer migrate into the adjacent silver halide layer.
Development of exposed silver halide to a negative image anchors the dye–developer molecule in position.
Dye–developer molecules in unexposed image areas are not used up by development but migrate into the receiving layer of the positive material.
There they are immobilized, remaining as dye images corresponding to a positive of each silver halide layer in the negative film.
The dyes thus re-create a full-colour positive image.
The process depends on the controlled diffusion of the dye–developer molecules, achieved by spacing layers and balanced exposure and development time.
Developing takes about one minute.
Polacolor films include an 8 × 10-inch material for regular studio and view cameras (with separate processing machinery) and giant formats of 20 × 24 inches or even larger for special cameras.
SINGLE-SHEET PROCESS
The Polaroid single-sheet, or integral, films contain all the negative and positive layers in a single preassembled film unit that is exposed through the transparent positive layer.
The unit incorporates a viscous processing reagent that acts in principle similarly to the chemistry of the Polacolor process.
It includes “opacifying” dyes and a highly opaque white pigment that together protect the negative layers against light during processing outside the camera.
The pigment provides a background to the positive image after the dye–developer molecules from the negative layers have migrated into the receiving layer.
Other constituents of the system neutralize residual active chemicals after processing, for all chemistry remains within the single-sheet print.
The print size is about 3 1/2 × 4 1/4 inches, the effective image size about 3 1/8 × 3 1/8 inches.
The Eastman Kodak and Fuji Photo Film companies also have marketed single-sheet films and cameras that accept each other’s films.
These materials and cameras are not compatible with the Polaroid products.
AUTOPROCESS MATERIALS
Because it requires cameras or camera backs with integral processing facilities, the instant-picture process is not suitable for conditions precluding immediate processing of the picture (e.g., in underwater or space photography), nor is it suitable for motion-picture or 35-mm cameras.
Alternative procedures suggested to overcome this usually involve some form of semidry rapid-access processing.
The Polaroid Autoprocess system used 35-mm film in standard cartridges to fit any 35-mm camera.
After exposure the film was driven through a tabletop processor, which sandwiched the film with a stripping film carrying a thin layer of processing fluid.
The latter processed the negative image, caused the formation of a positive image by a diffusion-transfer process, and then released the negative layers, which were finally removed from the film (together with residual chemicals) by the stripping material.
The transparencies remaining on the 35-mm film were immediately ready for viewing and projection.
Black-and-white as well as colour systems (by an additive process) were available in this form.
<Caption> In the Polaroid Autoprocess system, Polaroid Instant 35-mm transparency films - Polarchrome, Polapan, and Polagraph - were developed in a daylight processor to yield a filmstrip of dry images in less than three minutes.
APPLICATIONS
Instant-picture processes have an advantage in applications that need quick access to a finished print.
The initial field of the process was amateur snapshooting and instant portraits, from which evolved the taking of identification pictures for work and security passes.
Such passes are made with special cameras that record a portrait together with personal details on a composite print that is then laminated to form a tamper-proof identity card.
In studio photography instant prints provide a quick method of making exposure tests and checking the effect of lighting.
Largeand giant-format Polacolor prints are used in studio portraiture; normal instant prints have numerous commercial applications.
Instant pictures are also widely used in the laboratory to record experimental setups, for photomicrography and for infrared photography; for instant endoscopy and for clinical and forensic records; for rapid copying of normal colour transparencies; and for instant hard copy of oscilloscope, video, and computer graphic displays.
Autoprocess transparencies are used for the rapid production of colour or black-and-white slides for lectures and publication and in various fields of scientific photography (including photomicrography) relying on the use of conventional 35-mm (usually single-lens reflex) cameras.
CHAPTER SEVEN
SPECIAL PHOTOSENSITIVE SYSTEMS, SPECIAL TECHNIQUES, AND APPLIED PHOTOGRAPHY
The high working speed (efficiency of converting light into permanent images) of silver halides makes them almost the only materials suitable for camera use.
Numerous light-sensitive systems not using silver have been known since the beginning of photography.
In view of silver’s high price, a number of substitute systems have grown in importance, and new ones have appeared.
Most of them are limited to office copying, microfilming, the graphic arts, and other applications in which flat copy is reproduced.
ELECTROPHOTOGRAPHY
Electrophotography covers a number of processes that rely on photoconductive substances whose electrical resistance decreases when light falls on them.
A layer of such a substance with a grounded backing plate is given a uniform electrostatic charge in the dark.
When a light image is projected onto the surface, the photoconductor allows the electrostatic charge to leak away in proportion to the exposure.
This leaves an “image” charge that can be converted, in various ways, into a visible image.
In xerography the photoconductive layer is selenium, and the image is made visible by dusting the plate with an electrostatically charged powder (toner) having a charge that is the opposite of that of the electrostatic image.
The powder adheres to the image portions only and is then transferred to a sheet of plain paper also under the influence of electrostatic fields.
A final heat treatment fuses the powder into the paper for a permanent picture.
The process usually makes a positive from a positive original.
In office copying machines (the main application of xerography) the whole operating sequence is programmed and automated.
A zinc oxide-coated paper may replace the selenium plate; if so, the pigment powder deposit is fused directly into the paper surface.
The process is used mainly for line images without intermediate tones between black and white.
Modified procedures permit continuous-tone reproduction and - with coloured pigments - also colour printing.
In the electroplastic process a transparent thermoplastic serves as the photoconductive layer.
After the plastic is charged and exposed, the residual electrostatic charge forms stresses in the thermoplastic.
Controlled heating deforms the surface in the image areas into a grain pattern, which is frozen into the plastic on cooling.
The resulting image is light-scattering and is viewed by reflection or in special projection systems.
COLLOID AND PHOTOPOLYMER PROCESSES
A comparatively early non-silver process depended on organic colloid (gum or gelatin) treated with a bichromate.
Exposure to light hardened the gelatin, rendering it insoluble, while unexposed portions could be washed away with warm water, leaving a relief image.
Photopolymer systems substitute a plastic precursor in place of the gelatin.
The plastic precursor polymerizes to an insoluble plastic when exposed to light, and the unexposed soluble material is washed out by a suitable solvent.
Photopolymer processes have been adapted for forming resists (protective coatings) for etching, as, for instance, in the manufacture of printed circuits.
In indirect photopolymer systems a light-sensitive substance is mixed with a plastic precursor and on exposure decomposes into compounds that initiate polymerization of the plastic.
The polymerizable layer may include a pigment for a final coloured image.
Superimposing colour images derived from separation negatives can yield positives; systems of this type are used for quick colour proofing in photomechanical reproduction.
DIAZONIUM PROCESSES
A diazo, or dyeline, process depends on the decomposition by light of organic diazonium salts.
These salts can also couple with certain other compounds to form dyes.
After exposure only the exposed (and decomposed) diazonium salt forms dye, producing a positive image from a positive original.
The materials are usually papers or transparent supports impregnated with the required chemicals.
They are mainly sensitive to ultraviolet rays and can therefore be handled by normal tungsten lighting.
The light-decomposition of diazonium compounds also produces gaseous nitrogen.
This phenomenon is utilized in vesicular processes that incorporate the diazonium compound in a thermoplastic layer.
The nitrogen slowly diffuses out of this layer, but, if heat is applied immediately after exposure, the expanding nitrogen gas forms minute light-scattering bubbles visible as an image.
The scattering power corresponds to the exposure.
Further general exposure, after the plastic has cooled, decomposes the residual diazonium compound with gradual diffusion of the nitrogen out of the layer, destroying the latter’s light sensitivity.
This process and thermal dyeline systems are dry-processing instant-access systems and are used for making microfilm duplicates.
PHOTOCHROMIC SYSTEMS
Certain dyelike substances can exist in a colourless and a coloured state.
They are called photochromic compounds.
The coloured state is formed by exposure to radiations of a certain wavelength.
The compound reverts to its colourless state either in the dark or on treatment with radiation of a different wavelength.
This reversibility is a primary characteristic of photochromism, and it is an instant-image system involving no processing.
Photochromic systems are used in microrecording.
As the change of state takes place on a molecular level, the images are practically grain-free, and resolution is limited only by the resolving power of the optical system being used.
Photochromic materials can be negativeor positive-working.
With some photochromic compounds the dye image can be rendered permanent by optical or other treatment.
Glasses containing certain metal compounds also act as photochromic materials.
Exposure to light breaks down the compounds into metal that forms a visible (and permanent) image in the glass.
Another type of photochromic glass contains silver halide crystals dispersed in the glass melt.
The action of light decomposes the silver halide, forming a visible silver deposit.
The halogen cannot escape from the glass, so it recombines with the silver in the dark and the image fades.
Such photochromic glasses are incorporated in automatic light-control devices; light transmission decreases as the intensity of the light reaching the glass rises.
Such glass has found use in certain types of sunglasses.
ELECTRONIC PHOTOGRAPHY
As television cameras and recorders became more compact, home video recording began to replace home movies in the amateur field in the late 1970s.
Video recording of still images was incidental to this; it became widely involved in the storage of computer-generated or computer-processed images on magnetic tape or discs, for instance, in satellite photography, radiography, image scanning in picture transmission, and photomechanical reproduction.
A still video camera resembling traditional photographic apparatus (the Sony Mavica single-lens reflex) was first demonstrated in 1981.
It used a fast-rotating magnetic disc, two inches in diameter, recording on it up to 50 separate video images formed in a solid-state device in the camera.
The images could be played back through a television receiver or monitor, or converted to paper in a printer that uses the video signals to control a printout device.
Apart from being a potential rival to instant-picture photography, electronic records of this type are capable of direct transmission via telephone lines.
Thus the process is of interest to press photographers, who can transmit pictures from their cameras directly to newspaper editorial offices without intermediate processing.
The magnetic record also is able to directly control halftone engraving machines to engrave printing plates or cylinders.
HIGH-SPEED AND STROBOSCOPIC PHOTOGRAPHY
High-speed photography is generally concerned with exposure times shorter than about 1/1,000 second (one millisecond) and often exposures shorter than 1/1,000,000 second (one microsecond).
This field partly overlaps that of high-speed cinematography - sequences of very short exposures.
Exposure times can be reduced by high-speed shutter systems or by short-duration flash sources.
High-speed photography, together with high-speed cinematography, aids in the study of missiles, explosions, nuclear reactions, and other phenomena of military and scientific interest.
In industry high-speed pictures show up movement phases of machinery, relays, and switches; dynamic fractures of materials or insulation breakdown; and, in natural science studies, flight movement of birds and insects.
<Caption> This photograph of a hummingbird in a flower garden was taken using a high-speed exposure time.
HIGH-SPEED SHUTTERS
The shortest exposure with mechanical shutters is about 1/4,000 second.
Special high-speed shutter systems are magneto-optical, electro-optical, or electronic.
A magneto-optical shutter (Faraday shutter) consists of a glass cylinder placed inside a magnetic coil between two crossed polarizing filters; so long as the filters remain crossed, virtually no light can pass through.
A brief current pulse through the coil generates a magnetic field that rotates the light’s plane of polarization in the cylinder so that during the pulse some light passes through the second polarizing filter.
The electro-optical shutter (Kerr cell) is made up of a liquid cell of nitrobenzene fitted with electrodes and again placed between two crossed polarizers.
An electric pulse applied to the electrodes changes the polarization properties of the nitrobenzene so that this arrangement again transmits light.
Minimum exposure time is around five nanoseconds (5 × 10-9 second).
Image converter tubes electronically transmit and amplify an optical image focused on one end of a tube onto a phosphorescent screen at the other end.
Electrons flow in the tube only in the presence of an electric field, which can be controlled by short-time pulses down to a few nanoseconds.
HIGH-SPEED LIGHT SOURCES
The shortest electronic-flash duration is around one microsecond.
Spark discharges in air between electrodes yield still shorter exposures; discharge voltage may go up to tens or hundreds of thousands of volts.
Short-duration pulses applied to X-ray tubes produce X-ray flashes for high-speed radiography.
The shortest exposures are between 20 and 50 nanoseconds.
Special switching modes turn lasers into high-speed sources with durations down to a fraction of a nanosecond.
SYNCHRONIZATION
Generally the event photographed is made to trigger the exposure (the current pulse to operate the shutter or flash or spark source) to ensure correct synchronization.
Examples are bullets interrupting a light beam to a photocell or self-luminous phenomena (explosions) triggering the system via a photocell circuit.
The event and the exposure may be also triggered together by a signal from a common source.
STROBOSCOPIC PHOTOGRAPHY
Electronic-flash units designed to flash in rapid succession (up to several hundred times a second) can photograph a moving subject in front of a stationary camera with its shutter open to yield multiple images of successive movement phases.
The technique has been used in pictorial and sports photography (e.g., recording the movement of dancers or golfers) and for analyzing movement cycles without a motion-picture camera.
Stroboscopic flash can be synchronized with a selected movement phase of an object in rapid cyclic motion (e.g., a rotating machine component); the moving component illuminated in this way then appears stationary.
AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY
Photographs from airborne or spaceborne vehicles either provide information on ground features for military and other purposes (reconnaissance) or record the dimensional disposition of such features (surveying).
Reconnaissance photographs call for maximum sharpness and detail rendering.
Infrared films are often used to bring out details not discernible visually.
In nonmilitary applications such photographs may reveal ecological factors (tree diseases, crop variations) and traces of archaeological sites not visible from the ground.
Such shots are generally taken with cameras using 5or 9 1/2-inch roll film in large magazines, built into the aircraft and operated electrically by the pilot or other crew member, or automatically at set intervals.
Some systems incorporate a shutterless technique; the film runs continuously past a slit at a rate matched exactly to the image movement in the camera’s focal plane as the aircraft flies over the ground (image motion compensation).
<Caption> An aerial photograph of Hraunfossar Waterfalls in Iceland was taken using a drone.
Cutting-edge technology is making aerial photography readily accessible to greater numbers of photographers.
NADAR
Nadar was the pseudonym of Gaspard-Félix Tournachon (1820–1910), who was a French writer, caricaturist, and photographer and who is remembered primarily for his photographic portraits, which are considered to be among the best done in the 19th century.
As a young man, he studied medicine in Lyon, France, but, when his father’s publishing house went bankrupt in 1838, he was forced to earn his own livelihood.
He began to write newspaper articles that he signed “Nadar.”
In 1842 he settled in Paris and began to sell caricatures to humour magazines.
By 1853, although he still considered himself primarily a caricaturist, Nadar had become an expert photographer and had opened a portrait studio.
His immediate success stemmed partly from his sense of showmanship.
He had the entire building that housed his studio painted red and his name printed in gigantic letters across a 50-foot (15-metre) expanse of wall.
The building became a local landmark and a favourite meeting place of the intelligentsia of Paris.
When in 1874 the painters later known as Impressionists needed a place to hold their first exhibit, Nadar lent them his gallery.
He was greatly pleased by the storm the exhibit raised; the notoriety was good for business.
In 1854 he completed his first Panthéon-Nadar, a set of two gigantic lithographs portraying caricatures of prominent Parisians.
When he began work on the second Panthéon-Nadar, he made photographic portraits of the persons he intended to caricature.
His portraits of the illustrator Gustave Doré (c. 1855) and the poet Charles Baudelaire (1855) are direct and naturally posed, in contrast to the stiff formality of most contemporaneous portraits.
Other remarkable character studies are those of the writer Théophile Gautier (c. 1855) and the painter Eugène Delacroix (1855).
Nadar was a tireless innovator.
In 1855 he patented the idea of using aerial photographs in mapmaking and surveying.
It was not until 1858, however, that he was able to make a successful aerial photograph - the world’s first - from a balloon.
This led Daumier to issue a satirical lithograph of Nadar photographing Paris from a balloon.
It was titled Nadar Raising Photography to the Height of Art.
Nadar remained a passionate aeronaut until he and his wife and other passengers were injured in an accident in Le Géant, a gigantic balloon he had built.
In 1858 he began to photograph by electric light, making a series of photographs of Paris sewers.
Later, in 1886, he made the first “photo interview,” a series of 21 photographs of the French scientist Michel-Eugène Chevreul in conversation.
Each picture was captioned with Chevreul’s responses to Nadar’s questions, giving a vivid impression of the scientist’s personality.
Nadar also wrote novels, essays, satires, and autobiographical works.
Aerial survey is a systematic procedure of photographing the ground for map production; exposures are made at intervals to partly overlap the view of successive pictures.
The individual photographs are enlarged to the same degree and then assembled in a precise mosaic.
Aerial photographs taken under precisely specified conditions can serve for accurate measurements of ground details by stereoscopic evaluation.
SATELLITE AND SPACE PHOTOGRAPHY
Satellites orbiting Earth record changing meteorologic features (weather satellites) and broadcast the video images to ground stations where they may be recorded on magnetic tape or converted to hard-copy pictures by suitable printers.
Video cameras in spacecraft sent to record surface details of other planets similarly scan electronically the view taken in by a lens and beam the scanning signals back to Earth, where they are recorded and reconverted to visible images.
The signals are usually processed electronically to enhance image information and detail.
Such enhancement often brings out more information than can be recorded by conventional photography.
Similar techniques are used by military satellites monitoring ground features from high orbits above Earth.
UNDERWATER PHOTOGRAPHY
Underwater photography requires either special watertight cameras or pressure-resistant housings for normal cameras.
In both cases camera functions are controlled through pressure-tight glands.
A flat glass or plastic window is usually in front of the camera lens.
The red and yellow absorption of the water more than a few feet below the surface turns colour photographs taken by daylight into virtually monochrome shots; hence artificial light is essential to show up the full colour range of fish and other underwater subjects.
Light sources are battery-powered tungsten or tungsten-halogen lamps or electronic flash units (again in self-contained pressure-proof housings).
For comfortable handling the weight of the housing with camera is adjusted to slight negative buoyancy.
Complete camera and lighting outfits may be built into sledgelike or torpedo-like units with an electric or compressed-air motor for self-propulsion through the water.
Since the refractive index ratio of glass to water is lower than for glass to air, the light-bending power of a glass lens is less in water than in air.
This factor reduces the lens’s angle of view and makes objects appear at about three-fourths of their actual distance.
This difference must be allowed for in focusing - possibly by a suitably calibrated distance scale or by fitting the housing with a compensating porthole, which acts as a diverging lens.
Underwater cameras with lenses designed for direct contact with the water eliminate the air space between the lens and the porthole.
Such lenses can cover wider angles of view without distortion, but they do not give sharp images outside the water.
<Caption> An underwater photographer prepares to take a picture of coral and a clown fish using an underwater camera with video lights.
Most underwater photographers use flat or dome ports to cover the lens.
CLOSE-RANGE AND LARGE-SCALE PHOTOGRAPHY
Near photography to reveal fine texture and detail covers several ranges: (1) close-up photography at image scales between 0.1 and 1 (one-tenth to full natural size); (2) macrophotography between natural size and 10 to 20× magnification, using the camera lens on its own; (3) photomicrography at magnifications above about 20×, combining the camera with a microscope; and (4) electron micrography with an electron microscope at magnifications of 10,000 to 1,000,000×, which involves photography of the electron microscope’s phosphor screen or placing a photographic emulsion inside the vacuum chamber of the electron microscope to record directly the image formed by the electron beams.
CLOSE-UP AND MACROPHOTOGRAPHY
Supplementary close-up lenses or extension tubes (placed between the lens and camera body) allow the camera to focus on near distances for large scales of reproduction.
Special close-up rangefinders or distance gauges establish exactly the correct camera-to-subject distance and precise framing of the subject field.
Special simple close-up cameras, as in fingerprint recording and certain fields of medical photography, are permanently set to a fixed near distance and have a distance gauge or similar device built in.
Screen-focusing cameras (view and single-lens reflex) need no such aids, as the finder screen shows the precise focus and framing.
Extension tubes or extension bellows or both or “macro” lenses of extended focusing range are used for the macro range of distances.
For optimum image quality macrophotographic lenses specially corrected for large image scales may be used or the camera lens reversed back to front.
PHOTOMICROGRAPHY
There are two principal methods of photographing through a microscope.
In the first the camera, with its lens focused at infinity, is lined up in the optical axis of the microscope, which is also focused visually on infinity.
In the other method the camera without lens is positioned behind the microscope eyepiece, which is focused to project the microscope image directly onto the film.
Special photomicrographic cameras generally employ the second method.
Microscope adapters to provide a light-tight and rigid connection between the camera and microscope are available for both systems.
Such microadapters may incorporate their own shutter and a beam splitter system for viewing and focusing of the microscope image through a focusing telescope.
Photomicrographs are the essential adjunct to all microscopy to record biologic, bacteriologic, physical, and other observations in black-and-white or colour.
STEREOSCOPIC AND THREE-DIMENSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHY
Visual three-dimensional depth is perceived partly because of the fact that the human eyes see a scene from two viewpoints separated laterally by about 2 1/2 inches (6.4 centimetres) The two views show slightly different spatial relationships between near and distant objects (parallax); the visual process fuses these stereoscopic views into a three-dimensional impression.
A similar impression is obtained by viewing a pair of stereoscopic photographs taken with two cameras or a twin camera with lenses 2 1/2 inches apart, so that the left eye sees only the picture taken by the left-hand lens and the right eye only that of the right-hand lens.
Binocular viewers or stereo-selective projection systems permit such viewing.
Stereo photographs can also be combined in a single picture by splitting up the images into narrow vertical strips and interlacing them.
On superimposing a carefully aligned lenticular grid on the composite picture, an observer directly sees all the strips belonging to the left-eye picture with the left eye and all the strips belonging to the right-eye picture with the right eye.
Such parallax stereograms are seen in display advertising in shop windows.
They also can be reproduced in print, overlaid by a lenticular pattern embossed in a plastic covering layer.
Photogrammetry makes use of stereo photography in measuring dimensions and shapes of ground objects in depth, as from successive exposure pairs made during an aerial survey flight.
If all exposure parameters, including flying height, ground separation between exposures, and focal length of the aerial camera lens are known, the height of each ground feature can be measured.
Photogrammetric plotting instruments do this and draw height contour curves of all features for aerial maps.
Similar photogrammetric evaluation of stereo photographs of nearby subjects can also be made.
For instance, it is possible to reconstruct accurately the scene of a highway accident.
In industry a photogrammetric plot of an automobile model can be fed into a computer to program the machine tools that will shape the full-scale motor body components.
PHOTOGRAMMETRY
Photogrammetry is a technique that uses photographs for mapmaking and surveying.
As early as 1851 the French inventor Aimé Laussedat perceived the possibilities of the application of the newly invented camera to mapping, but it was not until 50 years later that the technique was successfully employed.
In the decade before World War I, terrestrial photogrammetry, as it came to be known later, was widely used; during the war the much more effective technique of aerial photogrammetry was introduced.
Although aerial photogrammetry was used primarily for military purposes until the end of World War II, thereafter peacetime uses expanded enormously.
Photography is today the principal method of making maps, especially of inaccessible areas, and is also heavily used in ecological studies and in forestry, among other uses.
From the air, large areas can be photographed quickly using special cameras, and blind areas, hidden from terrestrial cameras, are minimized.
Each photograph is scaled, using marked and known ground reference points; thus, a mosaic can be constructed that may include thousands of photographs.
Plotting machines and computers are used to overcome complications.
Instruments used in photogrammetry have become very sophisticated.
Developments in the second half of the 20th century include satellite photography, very large scale photographs, automatic visual scanning, high-quality colour photographs, use of films sensitive to radiations beyond the visible spectrum, and numerical photogrammetry.
INFRARED PHOTOGRAPHY
Images formed by infrared and heat radiations can be recorded directly, on films sensitive to them, or indirectly, by photographing the image produced by some other system registering infrared radiation.
Silver halide emulsions can be sensitized to infrared rays with wavelengths up to around 1,200 nanometres (one nanometre is 1/1,000,000 of a millimetre).
The usual sensitivity range is 800 to 1,000 nanometres.
Direct infrared-recording aerial photography shows up ground features of differential infrared reflection but similar light reflection (e.g., different types of foliage) and cuts through haze and mist.
Special colour films with an infrared-sensitive layer and processed to colours different from the natural rendering (false-colour films) show up such differences still more clearly.
In forensic photography infrared pictures reveal ink alterations in forgeries, differentiate stains, and help to identify specific textiles and other materials.
In medicine infrared photographs show subcutaneous blood vessels, as the skin is transparent to infrared.
<Caption> Egyptian authorities used images formed by infrared thermography to map the temperature of the walls of the Great Pyramid of Khufu (Cheops) in Cairo, Egypt, in 2015.
With suitable equipment it is possible to convert an infrared image into one visible on a fluorescent screen, where it can be photographed.
In infrared scanner systems a moving mirror scans the object or scene and focuses the radiation onto an infrared-sensitive cell.
The cell generates electric signals to modulate a light source, which, in turn, scans a photographic film or paper synchronously with the mirror.
The resulting image records hotter and colder parts of the object as lighter and darker areas and can accurately establish actual temperatures of subject details.
This system has been used to record temperature variations in the skin for the diagnosis of cancer.
ULTRAVIOLET PHOTOGRAPHY
Invisible shortwave ultraviolet radiations can be recorded directly or used in fluorescence photography.
For direct ultraviolet recording, the photographically useful wavelength range lies between 400 nanometres (visible violet) and about 200 nanometres and needs special optical systems transparent to ultraviolet rays (quartz, silica, or fluoride elements or combinations thereof).
Light sources rich in ultraviolet such as mercury vapour lamps - with an ultraviolet-transmitting, but visually opaque, filter in front of the camera lens - ensure that the photograph records only the ultraviolet-reflecting characteristics of the subject.
Fluorescence photography records the glow or visible light given off by certain substances when they are irradiated by ultraviolet rays.
The object is illuminated by screening out the visible light with a filter that transmits only ultraviolet radiation, and another filter that absorbs the ultraviolet rays is placed over the camera lens, permitting only the visible light (fluorescence) to be recorded on the film.
Normal lenses and panchromatic or colour materials are used.
Ultraviolet photography can identify or separate pigments and fabrics and can detect forgeries of documents.
Fluorescence photography can identify dyes, stains, specific chemical substances, and fluorescent components in microscope specimens.
Ultraviolet microscopy offers increased resolution through the shorter-wavelength radiations employed.
Aerial and satellite photography by ultraviolet can show up ultraviolet-reflective ground features.
RADIOGRAPHY AND OTHER RADIATION RECORDING TECHNIQUES
Silver halide emulsions are sensitive to X rays, gamma rays, and charged particles emitted by radioactive substances.
Some of these rays penetrate visually opaque materials to varying degrees to show up internal structures.
Radiography covers techniques of recording the subsurface features of objects.
X-RAY RADIOGRAPHY
X-rays (wavelengths between 1/100 and 1/100,000 that of visible light) are produced by high-voltage electron streams bombarding an electrode in a vacuum tube.
For radiography the object to be recorded is placed between an X-ray tube and the film; the film registers the differential absorption of the X-rays by the object’s internal structure as a projection shadowgraph.
The most familiar application is in medicine for diagnosis and recording, including dental radiography.
Industrial radiography permits nondestructive inspection of castings, welds, and engineering structures.
GAMMA RADIOGRAPHY
The technique of gamma-ray radiography is similar to that of X-ray radiography except that it relies on rays emitted by radioactive substances.
Gamma rays have wavelengths from 100 to 1,000 times shorter than X-rays and correspondingly greater penetrating power.
Small gamma-ray sources are placed in areas inaccessible to X-ray tubes, such as inside pipelines.
In all radiographic applications the exposure occurs under conditions of normal light, from which the radiographic film is protected by a light-tight (but radiation-transparent) wrapping.
AUTORADIOGRAPHY
Autoradiography records the distribution of radioactive materials in botanical and histological specimens placed in contact with a photographic emulsion.
This technique has been applied to the study of metabolism of plants and animals; it records the activity of organic compounds of radioactive isotopes introduced into the system of the plant or animal.
In engineering studies autoradiography can be used to follow the transfer of radioactive substances from one surface to another in lubrication.
The technique also has applications in machining and other metal-treatment processes.
NUCLEAR-TRACK RECORDING
Tracks of subatomic particles, such as protons, electrons, and mesons, produced by nuclear reactions can be recorded by photographic means.
The most common technique is to photograph the visible traces of such tracks in bubble or spark chambers with special camera and lens arrangements.
Different arrangements can provide for coverage of large fields or the recording of tracks simultaneously from several directions for three-dimensional reconstruction.
Particle tracks can be recorded directly in thick (up to one millimetre) emulsion layers or in emulsion stacks (up to 20 inches [up to 51 centimetres]) carried in high-altitude balloons and in spacecraft and satellites.
Special processing procedures are required to deal with these emulsion thicknesses.
ASTRONOMICAL PHOTOGRAPHY
By the cumulative effect of light received over a long period, a photographic emulsion can record celestial objects too faint to be visible.
Before radio telescopes photography was the only way of detecting many such objects.
Astronomical cameras are built onto high-power telescopes, typically reflecting systems.
The telescopes run on precision, clock-driven mounts to keep the optical axis stationary with respect to the sky area as Earth rotates during an exposure time, which can run into several hours.
For increased recording sensitivity, the telescope image may be intensified electronically.
Astronomical photographs taken through narrow-band colour filters - including infrared or ultraviolet transmitting filters - show selective emission characteristics of stars.
In the case of the Sun and of planets, such photographs can reveal some surface details not observable by white light.
Colour photographs reveal colours not directly visible because the intensity of starlight is too low to stimulate the eye’s colour-vision mechanism.
Spectrography records the composition of light emitted by stars and other objects, the star image of the telescope being photographed through a diffraction grating, a device that disperses white light into constituent wavelengths.
Elements present in the star or the gas mantle surrounding it can be identified from their characteristic spectral lines.
Displacement of such lines from their known wavelength position can indicate the velocity with which the distant stellar systems recede from or approach Earth.
MICROFILMING AND MICROREPRODUCTION
Microfilming is the copying of documents, drawings, and other such matter at a reduced scale - typically 1:15 to 1:42 - for compact storage.
Complete microreproduction systems include methods of filing the film copies for easy retrieval and reenlargement.
Various duplication methods allow microfilm records to be extensively distributed.
Documents, periodicals, and other printed matter are usually microfilmed on 16-mm film with an image size between 10 × 14 and 14 × 20 mm in a copying camera taking 100-foot lengths of film.
Engineering drawings of high information content are microfilmed on 35-mm unperforated film with a standard image size of 32 × 45 mm.
Films of up to 105 mm in width are also used.
Automated microfilm cameras run continuously, documents being fed onto a moving band carried past the camera at a steady speed while the film runs past a slit at a matched rate.
Readers and reader printers are desk-top projectors that display the frames reenlarged to about natural size on a back projection screen.
In a reader printer the image may also be projected on sensitized paper for full-size enlargements.
Advanced readers have elaborate retrieval systems based on frame coding and run the microfilm rolls through at high speed until a specific searched image is reached.
Aperture cards or standard-size transparent jackets store microfilm images as single frames or groups of frames.
Such unitized microfilms permit easier indexing and retrieval.
Certain 35-mm microfilm cameras photograph the original document directly on film premounted in an aperture card and processed on the spot.
Widely used is the unitized microfiche system, which carries up to 98 frames, each about 9 × 12 mm, on a 4 × 6-inch sheet of film.
The microfiche camera repositions the film frame by frame after every exposure.
Microfiche with a larger frame can also be produced by jacketing strips of 16-mm microfilm in multichannel plastic jackets 4 × 6 inches in size.
For greater space saving, microfilm images may be reduced beyond 1:100 on high-resolution photochromic image materials.
Extreme fine-grain silver copies then hold 3,000 to 4,000 individual frames on a single 4 × 6-inch film.
This method, useful for complex catalogs and like purposes, offers easy retrieval of individual frames but requires a high-magnification reader.
CHAPTER EIGHT
DIGITAL CAMERAS AND DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY
A digital camera is an electronic device that records and stores images and videos digitally as pixels, rather than on film.
Texas Instruments patented the first filmless electronic camera in 1972.
In 1975, Steven Sasson, an engineer working for Kodak, built the first digital camera using a charge-coupled device (CCD) to replace film.
The resulting images were recorded onto a tape cassette.
Digital photography started as a technical niche market, and many companies and professionals alike felt it would never replace film.
Kodak, then the world’s largest manufacturer of film, ignored its own digital invention and the steady rise of digital photography until it was too late to recover.
Kodak filed for bankruptcy in 2012.
In 2015 alone, more than one trillion digital photos were taken worldwide.
The number is expected to grow to 1.3 trillion by 2017.
Of this staggeringly large number of photos taken, 75 percent are now taken with mobile phones.
The percent of stand-alone digital cameras used around the world is expected to drop to just 13 percent by 2017 as more and more people use mobile phones as their camera of choice.
As digital photography, with its ease of use, replaced film, mobile phones, with their compact size and multitasking miniaturized portable computers and apps, have quickly come to dominate the physical camera market, causing a huge drop in point-and-shoot camera purchases.
Only larger, professional digital cameras have seen a rise in sales as the general population and the professionals influence these two dominant corners of modern photography.
Like the popular Kodak Brownie (1900) and Instamatic cameras (1960) from the past, the most popular camera in the world today is the iPhone by Apple.
DIGITAL CAMERA TYPES
There are many different types of digital cameras available today.
The most popular digital cameras are those incorporated into mobile phones.
Although there are many differences between digital cameras and film cameras, there are many similarities, too.
Most stand-alone digital cameras are not too dissimilar from film cameras.
Traditional camera parts such as the body, lenses, viewfinder, aperture, and shutter dials can often be found on professional, semi-professional, and even point-and-shoot cameras available on the market.
Digital camera manufacturers are still using traditional film camera ergonomics such as dials, manual focus, and aperture rings, but are eliminating some of the more cumbersome film camera elements, such as the prisms and mirrors, which led to bulkier camera bodies.
New features such as electronic viewfinders and LCD screens are also common on digital cameras.
Miniature cameras and technologies allow for creative uses and placement of modern cameras.
Cameras have been attached to drones to easily take aerial photos and digital videos that were previously almost impossible to achieve without a helicopter or weather balloon.
In 2013, Google released Google Glass, a headset-mounted mobile device and camera.
Even some mobile watches can take photos and store hundreds of digital photos.
<Caption> A digital single lens reflex camera (DSLR) on a tripod is being used to capture photographs of the Aurora Borealis (northern lights) in Iceland.
Digital cameras are commonly described by the digital resolution the internal sensors are capable of rendering in megapixels.
A megapixel equals one million pixels, or tiny areas of illumination on a display screen that makes up a picture.
More pixels do not automatically equal better image quality, as many manufactures of tiny cheap image sensors add more pixels without increasing sensor size.
Larger sensors with lower megapixels can often outperform cameras that advertise more megapixels because much detail is lost on the small sensors, despite the increase in overall pixels.
DSLR CAMERAS
A digital single lens reflex camera (DSLR) incorporates a mirror and a prism system behind the lens so that the photographer can see the exact image that will be recorded digitally.
Interchangeable lenses are used with this type of camera.
An optical viewfinder is used to see through the lens before the picture is taken.
The mirror behind the lens shifts out of the way just as the photo is taken.
This type of camera is most similar to traditional single lens reflex (SLR) film cameras and uses a charge-coupled device (CCD), or complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensors, in place of film.
The larger sensors found in DSLR cameras result in images with a high resolution, or more detail.
DSLR cameras also produce greater bit depth for images, which is the variation of colours a single pixel can display.
Higher resolution and greater bit depth produce more detailed images with a greater overall range of colours displayed.
A liquid crystal display (LCD) screen on the back of DSLR cameras allows the photographer to see the digital image both before and after it has been reordered.
DSLR cameras are used by professionals and semi-professionals and have very large image sensors that yield the highest quality digital images.
MIRRORLESS CAMERAS
Mirrorless digital cameras eliminate the mirror and prism viewfinder system used in DSLR cameras.
They often use interchangeable lenses, but sometimes have a nonremovable fixed-focus lens or a mechanical zoom lens permanently on the camera.
Mirrorless cameras are smaller than DSLR cameras and use an LCD screen on the camera back to compose and shoot the image.
Some mirrorless digital cameras have an electronic viewfinder (EVF), allowing the image from the lens and sensor to be displayed on a miniature LCD screen.
An EVF can be used like a DSLR viewfinder, by putting one’s eye up to the small viewfinder to compose the image.
Because the image is taken and transmitted to the miniature LCD screen electronically, no mirror or prism is needed for this.
Professionals and semi-professionals often use mirrorless digital cameras because the compact size provides convenience, and the larger image sensor size results in higher quality images than point-and-shoot or mobile phone cameras.
POINT-AND-SHOOT CAMERAS
Point-and-shoot digital cameras are small or compact cameras designed for automatic ease of use.
Within this category there are cameras with optical and digital zoom lens capabilities.
The combination of small size and automatic features along with high image quality make point-and-shoot cameras a good choice for untrained photographers.
Current point-and-shoot cameras are often advertised as having the capabilities of producing images superior to mobile phone cameras.
Despite their advantages over mobile phone cameras, the point-and-shoot market has continued to shrink as the quality of mobile phone cameras has improved.
LIGHT FIELD CAMERAS: AN EMERGING DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY
A light field camera is a new digital photographic process that records an image at multiple focal lengths so that the captured photos can be focused to various depths of field throughout the image after the photo has been taken.
Ren Ng developed the first prototype light field camera at Stanford University in 2006.
This focus-after-capture technology is achieved with multiple lenses recording all of the light information that enters the lens from every direction.
Software is then used to manipulate the data and refocus the image after the fact on a computer.
This action gives a photographer much more flexibility in manipulating a photo that would normally have just one recorded focal length.
This technology can also be used to generate 3D and holographic-style virtual reality video images.
Ren Ng’s company, Lytro, released the first-generation commercial light-field camera in 2012.
Lytro now sells a more advanced Lytro Illum light-field camera.
Other cameras such as the Samsung Galaxy S5 have after-the-fact focusing that mimics light-field photography.
The similar effect is achieved using multiple images captured at high speed then manipulated with software.
A Lytro Illum camera enables a person to change the focus after a photograph has been taken, to look at shots from different perspectives, and view images in 3D.
MOBILE PHONE CAMERAS
Mobile phone cameras are the most popular cameras in use.
They are miniature cameras that are incorporated into a smartphone cellular device.
The small, powerful computer capabilities of cell phones, such as iPhones, allow for photos to be altered, shared, texted, and sent directly from the phone to anywhere around the world instantly.
The mobile phone’s capability to do many things well in one device has resulted in a reduction of the similarly sized point-and-shoot cameras.
Instead of carrying both a phone and a camera, people tend to have a camera with them wherever they bring their phone, resulting in a greater number of digital cameras in the hands of consumers than ever before.
DIGITAL CAMERA PARTS
Digital camera parts can vary wildly among cameras, but most share many common parts.
Some digital cameras have parts so small they may be unrecognizable to the user.
On a large DSLR camera, parts such as the body and lens are obviously similar to traditional cameras.
On a mobile phone, however, the lens is often incredibly small and can easily be covered with a person’s finger.
When mobile phones first came equipped with cameras, they were low-quality novelty features.
Today the quality on many mobile phones is so good that the mobile phone market dominates the source of photos taken around the world.
Images taken with an iPhone can easily be used professionally and have even been seen on massive billboards to advertise image quality.
BODY
The body of a digital camera typically houses a sensor, electronics, a storage center, and sometimes the lens.
Camera bodies vary in size and shape.
Larger digital cameras can easily accommodate large sensors, mechanics for interchangeable lenses, mirrors and prisms for optical viewfinders, as well as ample space for large LCD screens, large batteries, fast shutters, and internal electronics, and miniature computer systems for onboard software.
Smaller cameras are not able to house as many of the same elements as larger cameras and still produce professional-quality images.
Mirrorless cameras are catching up fast to the quality of large DSLR cameras while eliminating parts such as mirrors, prisms, and viewfinders.
This omission helps to keep a small body size while allowing for high image quality.
Some point-and-shoot cameras and mobile phones have become so small that some level of quality must be sacrificed in favour of convenience and portability.
Many point-and-shoot cameras and mobile phones can easily fit in the photographer’s pocket.
To the average consumer, the quality that is lost with smaller cameras is negligible.
However, to the professional, that quality is of great importance.
SENSOR
A sensor is an electronic hardware device that converts the light coming into a camera into a digital image.
The two types of sensors available in most cameras are charge-coupled device (CCD) or complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS).
Technically, CCD sensors capture an image with a “global shutter,” activating all the pixels at once.
A CMOS sensor captures the image with a “rolling shutter,” or from top to bottom in a sequence.
CCD sensors were traditionally more expensive and often produced higher image quality with less noise (grain) than CMOS sensors.
Today however, CMOS sensors are cheaper to produce than CCD sensors, and the quality differences are negligible.
CMOS sensors also consume less power, which allows for longer shooting times before a camera battery runs out.
Improvements continue to be made to CMOS sensors, and they are becoming the industry standard.
Smaller sensors found in point-and-shoot cameras and mobile phones tend to not work well in low light and the resulting image becomes very noisy, or grainy.
Larger sensors found in DSLR or mirrorless cameras have sensors as large as a traditional piece of film, and can produce images with greater range of colours and work very well in low light.
<Caption> The 16.5-million-pixel CMOS APS-C sensor converts the light in this Leica T compact digital camera into a digital image.
LENS
Digital camera lenses come in all shapes and sizes and are entirely similar to traditional film cameras.
By using an adapter ring, traditional film lenses can often be used with DSLR and mirrorless cameras.
DSLR cameras have interchangeable lenses with mechanics built into the lens housing that allows them to autofocus aided by technology built into the camera body.
Point-and-shoot cameras typically have one adjustable lens built into the camera that allows for wide angle and telephoto (zoom) photos to be taken easily by hitting a button or turning a ring on the lens.
Pocket-sized point-and-shoot and mobile phone cameras have miniature fixed focus lenses that do not zoom optically.
To accomplish zooming, software is used to enlarge the image digitally with a digital zoom rather than optically.
STORAGE
Digital images taken with all digital cameras must be stored on physical media that will enable the image to be played back and manipulated.
Storage media for most digital cameras are tiny reusable memory cards that come in various storage sizes.
As the quality of digital images has improved over the years, so too has the amount of storage available on memory cards.
The size of memory cards, too, has gotten smaller and smaller as technology has improved.
Micro SD memory cards are now available for portable digital devices that are smaller than a postage stamp and can hold 128GB (gigabytes) of images.
One GB of storage capacity is equivalent to one billion bytes of information.
Common memory sizes for memory cards are 8GB, 16GB, 32GB, 64GB, and 128GB.
Mobile phones have internal built-in storage that is not removable, and the sizes available for memory are similar to removable memory cards for digital cameras.
The built-in memory for many smartphones, however, include the storage available for everything on the phone, not just the images.
Cloud storage is another new method for storing files and digital images.
Cloud-based storage is remotely stored, typically by a large company such as Apple, Microsoft, Google, or Facebook, and must be accessed on a mobile device via Wi-Fi or cellular networks.
The advantage of cloud-based storage is that data is backed up independently from a mobile device or camera and can be accessed across multiple devices, i.e., a mobile phone, tablet, laptop, or desktop computer.
SOFTWARE
Software provides the digital commands or instructions a camera uses to control various aspects of digital photography.
Software that is permanently installed onto a digital camera or other digital device is called firmware.
Each type of digital camera has unique software programmed into it.
Firmware can sometimes be updated by connecting the digital camera to the Internet and downloading updated firmware made available by the manufacturer of the digital camera or device.
Updated firmware for digital cameras typically adds new and improved features.
For example, software updates might eliminate system-wide programming errors, called bugs, or they might improve battery life, exposure, and other camera features.
THE FIRST DIGITAL CAMERA
In 1975, Kodak employee Steven Sasson created the world’s first digital camera.
He had been working with the then-recent invention, the charge-coupled device (CCD).
He experimented with the way light hitting the device was converted into electronic signals.
He added a lens from a Super-8 camera to focus incoming light, and then digitized the electronic signals into numbers.
To record the resulting digital information so that an image could be saved and played back, he added a tape recorder, batteries, and many circuit boards.
The result was a cobbled-together device that weighed about 8 pounds (3.6 kilograms) and was considered the first digital camera.
Kodak patented the first digital camera in 1978 but continued to pursue film rather than digital photography.
Kodak’s inability to shift from film to digital eventually led to its bankruptcy in 2012.
A few years earlier, in 2009, Steven Sasson was awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation by President by Barack Obama at the White House for his contribution of the digital camera.
In 2005 Steven Sasson holds his 1975 prototype digital camera (left) and the 2005 EasyShare One point-and-shoot wireless digital camera at the Eastman Kodak Company.
DIGITAL CAMERA TECHNIQUES
Many of the basic processes and principles found in traditional photography are present in digital photography.
Light still enters a digital camera and the resulting image seen by the photographer must be composed and then the shutter clicked.
Camera manufacturers have gone out of their way to make taking digital pictures as simple as possible, incorporating software and hardware that aid in light metering, colour balance, and focusing so that the photographer is met with as much success as possible capturing the image.
PARALLELS TO TRADITIONAL PHOTOGRAPHY
Many of the techniques used in digital photography parallel the techniques of traditional photography.
Many of the same aspects of composition, shutter speed, aperture, light balance, and ISO relate to professional and semi-professional digital photography.
However, there is much more freedom with digital photography than with film photography.
Not only are the results instant, but there are no chemicals, darkroom procedures, or film costs.
In addition to traditional shooting techniques, the following tools can be used to create professional-looking digital photographs after they have been taken.
COMPUTERS AND DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY
Computers are an integral part of modern digital photography.
With film photography, film rolls needed to be developed and then the resulting negatives needed to be printed onto light-sensitive paper in darkrooms.
Chemicals and specialized equipment were required for processing, and the consumer photographer brought rolls of film to a store for development and printing.
With digital photography, computers and various types of software replace the traditional darkroom and anyone - pro or amateur - can crop, colour-correct, lighten, darken, and manipulate digital photos with software such as Adobe Photoshop, Lightroom, or various photo applications, called apps.
Computers with many gigabytes or terabytes of internal or external storage can hold thousands of digital images that can be printed from home ink jet and laser printers, or uploaded to companies through the Internet for the creation of books, cards, and even posters made from the images people take.
Even mobile phones have the ability, with various software apps, to adjust and alter digital photos and print them wirelessly via Wi-Fi.
RAW VERSUS JPEG FILE FORMATS
Digital images are converted into image file formats that can be read by cameras and computers for viewing and manipulating.
Although there are many different types of image file formats, the most common file format is JPEG, which stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group - the name of the group that determined the image standard.
Most digital cameras take pictures in the JPEG format.
JPEG images are compressed, and don’t take up much space so they can be easily transmitted.
Because of the JPEG images’ small size the Internet also uses the JPEG file format so transmission of JPEGs from cameras to the Internet is effortless.
Mobile phones, tablets, e-books, e-mail, and texting programs all use the JPEG standard.
The next most common image file format that cameras use is the Camera RAW format.
Raw images are uncompressed and take up much more space than a JPEG image of the same size.
Images in the Camera RAW format contain all the information that the camera’s sensor recorded.
RAW files need to be converted with a RAW converter to be viewed on a device or a computer.
Professional photographers often take photos using the Camera RAW file format because of the tremendous leeway it gives them when adjusting the images after they are taken.
Many digital cameras that shoot RAW photographs can also record a JPEG file, simultaneously giving the photographer the best of both worlds.
FILTERS
Many cameras - traditional and digital - make use of filters to aid in the adjustment of the image both before and after the photo is taken.
Digital cameras with lenses can make use of physical filters that attach over the lens to aid clarity, reduce glare, and adjust contrast.
Traditional black-and-white film photographs often incorporate coloured filters over the lens to help accentuate different parts of an image or create special effects in colour or dynamics.
Digital camera software has many virtual filters to adjust the digital image the way a physical filter traditionally did.
Virtual filters make it very easy for a digital photographer to achieve a variety of results by simply adjusting a setting on his or her camera.
Other virtual filters typically found on many digital cameras reproduce various types of vintage black-and-white and colour film types.
Mobile phone users can download photo apps that allow them to instantly adjust their photos, yielding a multitude of different artistic results.
One very popular filter app for mobile phone photography is Instagram, which allows the user to take square pictures, adjust them with many filters and settings, and share them online with friends, family, or the entire world.
Mobile phones are now made with software that allows the user some form of virtual filter adjustment for photos, either before or after they are taken.
<Caption> Instagram has a filter app, seen here on an iPhone screen, that enables photographers to take square pictures, change them with filters and settings, and then share them online.
USING APPS
Since the first iPhone was released in 2007, digital photography apps in mobile phones have become very popular.
As the results of the apps become more sophisticated, they are also becoming easier for the consumer to use.
Hipstamatic, SnapChat, VSCO Cam, Snapseed, and Instagram are just several in the very long list of photo apps available for mobile phones.
Photography apps can be used to shoot, store, and manipulate images.
In addition, most photo apps available for phones can be used to share images to popular online social media websites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google+.
Stand-alone photo sharing services such as Flickr, meant for photographers to store digital images, also have their own mobile photo apps for uploading and sharing images.
One mobile photo application, Instagram, which launched in 2010, went on to dominate mobile photo sharing.
The app quickly became very popular, and in 2012 Facebook purchased Instagram for 1 billion dollars.
The simple photo app is used to take, filter, and share photos.
Users can also tag friends and leave comments under photos.
Users can chose to follow anyone who has made his or her account public.
The U.S. singer Taylor Swift has the most popular personal account on Instagram with more than 55.7 million followers as of 2015.
As of 2015 Instagram has more than 400 million users and has stored nearly 40 billion photos.
HDR PHOTOGRAPHY
High dynamic range (HDR) photography is a specialized imaging technique that combines information from multiple photographs in which the resulting image displays a broad range of colours, clarity, and luminosity.
HDR images are created by taking several images at various exposures and combining them on a computer after they have been taken.
The resulting HDR image will contain all the details from every part of an image - over and underexposed.
To achieve HDR images, the camera will typically need to be on a tripod so that all the exposures to be combined later will match one another perfectly.
Some professional cameras have HDR settings built in so that the number of images shot and the variations between exposures can be set in advance and taken with one click of the shutter.
Many mobile phones even have HDR capabilities in which the onboard software combines the exposures and creates a result with fewer underexposed or overexposed areas.
An HDR photograph of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Albany, New York, illustrates the wide tonal range and vivid details the technique is capable of delivering.
IMAGE EDITING PROGRAMS
Digital photos are made up of pixels.
Image editing applications allow these pixels to be manipulated.
Although there are many image editing applications available for home computers, Adobe Photoshop was the first, and it is still the most popular application for adjusting images on a computer.
Adobe Photoshop is a desktop computer application for creating, editing, and manipulating digital images.
The desktop program was invented in 1988 by Thomas and John Knoll.
In 1990, Adobe purchased the application and released the first version of the program.
Traditional film images can be scanned into a computer and converted into bitmapped digital images so they can be altered in the application.
Digital images can be manipulated in a variety of ways in the program.
With many virtual layers multiple photos can be collaged and combined together.
Photographs can be manipulated, lightened, darkened, cropped, resized, and colour-corrected globally or zoomed in with such detail that just a single pixel can be manipulated.
Various tools in Photoshop allow for manipulation of a selected area of a photo.
Traditional burning (darkening) and dodging (lightening) of a photo that was done in the darkroom can be accomplished with brush tools that can be adjusted to different sizes.
RAW and JPEG images can both be opened and manipulated in Photoshop, as well as many other image file formats.
CHAPTER NINE
PHOTOGRAPHY’S PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
Most of the billions of photographs taken today are snapshots - casual records to document personal events such as vacations, birthdays, and weddings.
Photographs are used extensively by newspapers, magazines, books, and television to convey information and advertise products and services.
Practical applications of photography are found in nearly every human endeavor from astronomy to medical diagnosis to industrial quality control.
Photography extends human vision into the realm of objects that are invisible because they are too small or too distant, or events that occur too rapidly for the naked eye to detect.
A camera can be used in locations too dangerous for humans.
Photographs can also be objects of art that explore the human condition and provide aesthetic pleasure.
For millions of people, photography is a satisfying hobby or a rewarding career.
PHOTOGRAPHY AND THE MEDIA
Photography’s unique powers of visual description have been used to record, report, and inform since its invention in 1839.
People prefer to see things with their own eyes, but when this is impossible the camera can often serve the same purpose almost as well.
It is not true that photographs never lie - they can be falsified and manipulated.
Nevertheless, a photograph can carry a strong measure of authenticity and conviction.
As a nonverbal means of communication, photography can surmount the barriers of language and communicate through universal visual symbols.
Photographs are well suited for use in the mass media.
Today they are reproduced by the billions, and they can be found everywhere: in the pages of newspapers, magazines, books, catalogs, and brochures; on display in billboards, shop windows, and posters; broadcast over television; organized into slide shows and film strips; and on the Internet and mobile applications.
In photography’s early days some of its most eagerly sought images were those brought back by explorers and travelers.
These would satisfy people’s curiosity about distant places like China, Egypt, and the American West.
That same kind of curiosity exists today.
People are fascinated with photographs of the surface of the moon, the landscape of Mars, and the appearance of other planets in the solar system.
Photographs in the mass-communication media have made the faces of political leaders, popular entertainers, and other celebrities familiar to the public.
When a newsworthy event occurs, photojournalists are there to record it.
Photojournalists sometimes spend months covering a story.
The result of such labor is often a powerful, revealing picture essay that probes far beneath the surface of events.
Photography is also essential to the advertising industry.
In efforts to sell a product, attractive photographs of the item are used.
Photography is also widely used in education and training within the academic world, industry, and the armed services.
<Caption> William Henry Jackson photographed the Grand Canyon in the Yellowstone area in 1872 while on a geologic survey expedition.
This image, along with others, helped to sway the U.S. Congress to create Yellowstone National Park, the nation’s (and the world’s) first national park.
Photographs are also often used in attempts to sway public opinion.
Governments, political parties, and special-interest groups have long used the graphic representation and emotional impact of photographs to further their causes.
Such use may result in destructive propaganda, such as that of the Nazis during the Third Reich.
Significant changes have been brought about by way of photography.
Photographs of the Yellowstone region, for example, were instrumental in Congress’s decision to establish that area as a national park in 1872; and photographs of child laborers helped to bring about legislation protecting children from exploitation as early as 1916.
PHOTOGRAPHY IN INDUSTRY, RESEARCH, AND SCIENCE
Photography has many practical applications in industry, medicine, astronomy, archaeology, scientific research, the graphic arts, law enforcement, and many aspects of contemporary life.
Aerial photography, for example, is used to make maps and contour charts, to study Earth and its oceans, and to help forecast the weather.
Cameras aboard satellites and space vehicles have photographed Earth, as well as the Moon, the Sun, and the other planets.
Astronomers use photography to study galaxies in deep space and to analyze the composition of stars through spectroscopy.
New photographic applications are constantly being developed.
Industrial and scientific researchers rely heavily on photography.
For example, objects too small to be seen with the naked eye can be clearly recorded in photomicrographs - photographic images made through optical or electron microscopes.
Ultrahigh-speed electronic-flash photography can record events that happen too fast to be seen by the unaided eye.
With exposures as brief as one-millionth of a second, an electronic-flash photograph can “freeze” a bullet traveling at 15,000 miles per hour (24,000 kilometres per hour).
IMOGEN CUNNINGHAM
Imogen Cunningham (1883–1976) was an American photographer who is best known for her portraits and her images of plant life.
Cunningham studied at the University of Washington in Seattle, where she developed an interest in photography.
Her earliest prints were made in the tradition of Pictorialism, a style of photography that imitated academic painting from the turn of the century.
After studying photography at the Technische Hochschule in Dresden, Germany, from 1909 to 1910, Cunningham opened a portrait studio in Seattle in 1910 and soon established a solid reputation.
Her commercial portraiture was straightforward, but she continued to produce soft-focused allegorical prints.
She married etcher Roi Partridge in 1915, and the couple moved to San Francisco in 1917.
By the early 1920s Cunningham began to change her style, creating close-up, sharply detailed studies of plant life and other natural forms.
Her experiments with form allied her with other Modernist photographers at the time, and in 1932 Cunningham joined the association of West Coast photographers known as Group f.64.
Like other members of the group, she rejected the soft-focused sentimental subjects that were then popular in favour of images such as Two Callas (c. 1929), which conveys a sensuous delight in nature.
Cunningham was known for her portraits and images of plant life, such as Two Callas, About 1925.
In the early 1930s, Cunningham worked briefly for Vanity Fair and produced images of entertainers and celebrities.
After the breakup of Group f.64, she ran a portrait gallery and taught at several California art schools.

Imogen Cunningham Photographs, 1910–1973, was published in 1974, and her final photographs were published in After Ninety in 1977.
Photography is used extensively in medicine and dentistry for research, teaching, and as a day-to-day diagnostic tool.
Especially important are films made with X-rays, which reveal the body’s inner structure.
The world of miniaturized electronic equipment would not be possible without photography.
A photographic etching process called photoresist is used to produce the extremely small but precisely printed microelectronic chips that are the “brains” of modern electronic hardware.
Photography by ultraviolet light has a number of applications, including the detection of forged or altered documents, the identification of chemical compounds, and the examination of bacterial colonies.
Infrared photography can, in effect, “see in the dark.”
It can record invisible infrared illumination.
It has significant military and surveillance uses and is also employed in medical and astronomical photography.
A FINE ART
Today photography is widely recognized as a fine art.
Photographs are displayed in art museums, prized by collectors, discussed by critics, and studied in art history courses.
Because of the special nature of photography, however, this was not always the case.
In the early days of photography some people considered the medium something of a poor relation to the older, established visual arts, such as drawing and painting.
The arguments stemmed from the fact that a camera is a mechanical instrument.
Because the mechanical procedure of taking a picture is automatic, detractors claimed that photography required no coordination of hand and eye and none of the manual skills essential to drawing and painting.
They also argued that photography required no creativity or imagination because the photographic subject was “ready-made” and did not require manipulation or control by the photographer.
A camera, no matter how many automatic features it may have, is a lifeless piece of equipment until a person uses it.
It then becomes a uniquely responsive tool - an extension of the photographer’s eye and mind.
A photographer creates a picture by a process of selection.
Photographers looking through the camera’s viewfinder must decide what to include and what to exclude from the scene.
They select the distance from which to take the picture and the precise angle that best suits their purpose.
They select the instant in which to trip the shutter.
This decision may require hours of patient waiting until the light is exactly right or it may be a split-second decision, but the photographer’s sense of timing is always crucial.
Photographers can expand or flatten perspective by the use of certain lenses.
They can freeze motion or record it as a blur, depending on their choice of shutter speed.
They can create an infinite number of lighting effects with flashes or floodlights.
They can alter the tonal values or colours in a picture by their choice of film and filters.
These are only a few of the controls available to a photographer when taking a picture.
Later, in the darkroom, many additional choices are available.
One of the best ways to view artistic photographs is to visit museums.
Today most art museums include photography exhibitions, and many have a photography department and a permanent collection of photographic prints.
This is a relatively recent development.
The first international exhibition of artistic photography took place in Vienna, Austria, in 1891, and in 1910 the Albright Gallery in Buffalo, N.Y., held a large exhibition of work by contemporary photographers.
This exhibition was sponsored by a group of photographers, including Alfred Stieglitz and Edward Steichen, known as the Photo-Secession group.
It was not until 1940, however, that a museum - the Museum of Modern Art in New York City - established a separate department of photography.
<Caption> Alfred Stieglitz’s Winter, Fifth Avenue, a photogravure, was published in Camera Work, No.
12, in October 1905.
Stieglitz worked to have photography accepted as a fine art.
The Metropolitan Museum of Art, also in New York City, created a department devoted solely to photography in 1992.
The International Museum of Photography at George Eastman House in Rochester, N.Y., has one of the world’s greatest historical collections.
In Washington, D.C., the Library of Congress, the National Archives, and the Smithsonian Institution also house extensive photographic collections.
Today photography collections exist in art museums throughout the world and in some colleges and universities.
Founded in 1974, the International Center of Photography contains archives, collections, and a research center in Jersey City, N.J., until its new exhibition space has been completed in New York City, and a school in New York City.
Chicago’s Museum of Contemporary Photography is the Midwest’s greatest repository of photography and an active supporter of working photographers.
There has also been a growth of photographic galleries and art galleries that maintain a photographic department.
Major events for collectors, gallery owners, and art dealers are the auctions held periodically by major art dealers.
Here, rare or sought-after photographs may command thousands of dollars.
PHOTOGRAPHY AS A POPULAR PASTIME
Taking photographs is a popular activity.
The invention and widespread ownership of the smartphone means that nearly everyone has access to a camera at any given moment.
However, some 4 1/2 million persons are seriously interested in photography as a hobby.
They usually own more advanced cameras and additional photographic equipment such as extra lenses, tripods, electronic flash units, and filters.
Often they have some interest in doing their own darkroom work.
With today’s digital and automated cameras, fast films, and simplified processing methods, photography has become a rewarding hobby that offers many levels of satisfaction.
As a visual activity it stimulates the photographer to see things in a new way.
A successful photographer learns to see in a clear, sensitive, and perceptive manner.

Photography is an active hobby that can be enjoyed in connection with such interests and activities as nature study, gardening, or travel.
Camera clubs can be found in many communities, schools, and colleges.
Members often exchange information, share and discuss their work, and listen to guest lecturers.
Workshops and short courses on photography are also available.
And through blogs and social media, almost anyone can show their work to a wider community.
JAMES NACHTWEY
James Nachtwey (1948– ) is a photojournalist noted for his unflinching and moving images of wars, conflicts, and social upheaval.
Nachtwey graduated from Dartmouth College, Hanover, N.H., where he studied art history and political science, and then served in the merchant marine.
Influenced by the work of still photographers during the Vietnam War and impressed by the power of photos to communicate the immediacy of events, he became a self-taught student of photography.
From 1976 to 1980 he was a newspaper photographer in New Mexico, and in 1980 he moved to New York City to work as a freelance photographer.
There he joined Black Star agency.
After his first foreign assignment, in Northern Ireland, he worked in Central America, the Middle East, Africa, and Eastern Europe.
The images he recorded in those places appeared in a number of international publications, including National Geographic, Life, Time, El País, and L’Express.
In 1984 he became a contract photographer with Time magazine.
He was a member of Magnum photography cooperative from 1986 to 2001, when he became one of the founding members of the photo agency VII, named for the number of its founding members.
He has received many of the most respected photography awards, many of them multiple times, notably the Robert Capa Gold Medal, Magazine Photographer of the Year, and World Press Photo of the Year.
Compared to Robert Capa for his sense of compassion and commitment and to Henri Cartier-Bresson, who inspired him, for his composition, Nachtwey said of his own work:
I use what I know about the formal elements of photography at the service of the people I’m photographing - not the other way around.
I’m not trying to make statements about photography.
I’m trying to use photography to make statements about what’s happening in the world.
I don’t want my compositions to be self-conscious.
This compassion - which is particularly compelling in view of the death, destruction, and inhumanity he has witnessed for more than two decades - has enabled him both to be present at and to record the heart-wrenching moments in personal lives throughout the world.
His books include Deeds of War (1989) and Inferno (1999).
War Photographer (2001) is a documentary film about Nachtwey and his work.
His wound was not life-threatening and he continued his work after he was injured.
In 2015 he received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Society of Magazine Editors.
PHOTOGRAPHY AS A VOCATION
Few careers offer a greater variety of opportunities than does photography.
Some professional photographers work as full-time employees, some run their own businesses, and some freelance.
Commercial photographers who work for advertising agencies photograph products for advertising promotions, brochures, catalogs, and other purposes.
Their work can range from simple, straightforward shots to elaborate studio setups.
Some commercial photographers may specialize in certain product areas, such as fashion, food, or hardware.
Portrait photographers take pictures of people, singly or in groups, for display in homes and offices.
Wedding photographers take formal portraits of the bride, groom, and wedding party and also provide a candid coverage of the ceremony.
Industry uses photographers to photograph plants, manufacturing processes, products, workers, and executives.
Photographers who work on annual reports must produce pictures that are visually interesting and that show the corporation in a favourable light.
Photojournalists are reporters with a camera, photographing current events and people for newspapers, magazines, and the electronic media.
This physically demanding, and sometimes dangerous, work requires both journalistic and photographic skills.
Today most successful photojournalists are graduates of a journalism school that has a photojournalism department or offers photojournalism courses.
Many photographers enter the field professionally after gaining experience as amateurs.
They may spend time as assistants or apprentices before striking out on their own.
Even after the advent of digital photography, there are a variety of opportunities for specialists and technicians in photography.
For example, highly skilled darkroom technicians are still needed by custom labs that cater to professionals.
CONCLUSION
The transformation of photography from an analog medium relying on chemically developed light-sensitive emulsions to one using digital technologies for image capture and storage began in the late 1980s with the introduction of the first consumer digital cameras and in 1990 the first version of Adobe Photoshop, a program for adjusting and manipulating digital image files.
Conceived as an extension of the conventional darkroom, the program adopted many of the traditional tools of black-and-white film photography but let photographers go even further.
By giving photographers the ability to easily change the structure of an image, and even its contents, it called into question long-held assumptions about photographic veracity or documentary “truth value.”
To some minds, it changed the very nature of the medium.
Digital photography’s full impact was not felt until the first decade of the new century.
Because digital images could be transmitted and edited much more quickly, by decade’s end nearly all newspapers and magazines had transitioned to a digital workflow process, and their photographers were using digital cameras designed for professionals.
As a result of the Internet, which digital photography was no small part of, print media in general began its decline.
Despite the fact that traditional photos had been altered and manipulated since photography’s inception, digital photographs could be manipulated far easier and the results were not always readily apparent to the public.
For example, in 1982 National Geographic magazine published an altered image of the Egyptian pyramids on its cover.
Because the magazine’s cover required a vertical image, editors used early computer software to push the pyramids closer together than they appeared in the original film photograph.
The manipulation of visual fact for increased visual impact extends back before computers into the 19th century, notably during the Crimean War and American Civil War, but a spate of incidents of digital alteration of news photographs in the first decade of the 21st century created an uproar and led to the establishment of journalistic codes of ethics intended to regulate the alteration of digital images.
Several photojournalists lost their jobs after their published pictures were found to have been digitally doctored.
Whereas photojournalists and documentarians reacted with caution to what came to be called digital imaging, other types of photographers were generally enthusiastic about its possibilities.
Many artists using photography as their medium developed creative approaches that took advantage of the seamless mutability of digitally altered images, extending a long history of photographic collage, double printing, and other pre-digital forms of manipulation.
Among the early adopters were Aziz + Cucher (Anthony Aziz and Sammy Cucher), Andreas Gursky, and Loretta Lux, all of whom stretched the limits of what is believable about a photographic image.
Digital alteration also influenced the spheres of fashion and celebrity, as photographers such as Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin (working together as Inez & Vinoodh) remade the looks of models and movie stars.
Magazines began to regularly send their cover photographs to digital retouchers to eliminate blemishes and minimize their models’ waistlines.
Arguably the most profound impact of digital photography has been the proliferation of picture taking and picture sharing.
Since 2007, the year Apple introduced its first iPhone, smartphones have become ubiquitous, as have picture-sharing applications like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram that enable users to upload pictures from phone to Internet in a matter of seconds.
One result has been an almost unfathomable archive of images of mundane events and everyday places, a virtual map of the world that finds its commercial equivalent in Google Earth, which incorporates both satellite views and Google Street View, an assemblage of ground-level pictures of human habitation.
At the same time, commercial, governmental, and military uses of photography have expanded to include 24-hour surveillance of public sites and businesses, the remote targeting of drone missile strikes, databases of digital fingerprints, portraits on identification cards, and the development of face-recognition software to aid in the identification of criminals and terrorists.
Debates about the impact of the camera on civil liberties have intensified as a result.
Photographers have reacted to digital photography’s omnipresence in a variety of ways.
Some - such as Chuck Close, Sally Mann, Deborah Luster, and Jerry Spagnoli - have journeyed back to photographic processes of the 19th century, making daguerreotypes or working with wet-collodion plates, or - like Chris McCaw and Alison Rossiter - have taken to printing on outdated enlarging paper from the mid-20th century.
Photographic books, predicted to be made obsolete by readily viewable online images, have experienced a resurgent popularity, not only because digital printing has reduced the cost of publication but also because books allow photographers to control the narrative sequence and context in which their images are seen.
Others have seized an opportunity to critically reflect on the new image environment in which they live.
Trevor Paglen, for example, has photographed the light trails of spy satellites as they cross the night sky.
In addition, the convergence of still digital photographs and moving video images and the popularity of web design tools that allow for animation, motion control, and audio editing have produced a creative arena in which photography is but one tool in the production of multimedia experiences.
In the 21st century, photography has been absorbed into both the contemporary art world and that of online digital communication, blurring its formerly distinct identity but vastly enhancing its importance as a visual medium.
<Caption> Trevor Paglen poses in front of one of his astrophotographs at a 2009 exhibition in Germany.
Paglen uses cameras mounted on high-powered astronomical telescopes with focal lengths up to 7000mm.
The scale and impact digital photography and social media have had globally are stunning.
U.S. president Barack Obama has Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook accounts, as do many politicians and celebrities.
News, elections, sports, entertainment, and popular culture all filter through social media at lightning speed.
Today it is often no longer the professional photographer but rather the everyday citizen who is recording the important news stories of the day.
Trending is a new term in which the overall ebb and flow of the news or topic of the moment can now be monitored as photos are hashtagged and posted by the public and often picked up by the mainstream media.
Global events such as the Arab Spring and the Syrian civil war that began in 2011 have been altered and driven by social media sites such as Twitter and Instagram, in which users have shared information and photos instantly.
News outlets today often follow news trends along with the public, by searching hashtags.
Most news reporters today have social media pages including Instagram where they can share photos of their everyday lives with the world.
Since it was first invented, photography as a tool for communication has grown substantially.
With current trends in technology, photography’s impact throughout the world will continue to shape society and how people view the world.
